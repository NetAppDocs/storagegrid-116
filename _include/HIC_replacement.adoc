//HIC replacement procedure for E2800 series controllers

== Move HIC to new controller, if needed
.Steps

 . If the failed controller includes a host interface card (HIC), move the HIC from the failed controller to the replacement controller.
+
A separate HIC is used for the E2800B controller only. The HIC is mounted to the main controller board and includes two SPF connectors.  
+
NOTE: The illustrations in this procedure show a 2-port HIC. The HIC in your controller might have a different number of ports.  

 . If the controller does not have a HIC (E2800A), replace the controller cover. If the controller does have a HIC (E2800B), proceed to <<move_the_HIC_to_the_replacement_controller, move the HIC from the failed controller to the replacement controller>>.

 .. [[move_the_HIC_to_the_replacement_controller]]If equipped with a HIC, move the HIC from the failed controller to the replacement controller.
.. Remove any SFPs from the HIC.
.. Using a #1 Phillips screwdriver, remove the screws that attach the HIC faceplate to the controller.
+
There are four screws: one on the top, one on the side, and two on the front.

.. Remove the HIC faceplate.
.. Using your fingers or a Phillips screwdriver, loosen the three thumbscrews that secure the HIC to the controller card.
.. Carefully detach the HIC from the controller card by lifting the card up and sliding it back.
+
CAUTION: Be careful not to scratch or bump the components on the bottom of the HIC or on the top of the controller card.
