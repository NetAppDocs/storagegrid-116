//This is the shared info about AutoSupport messages for Admin and Primer topics//


AutoSupport messages include information such as the following:

* StorageGRID software version
* Operating system version
* System-level and location-level attribute information
* Recent alerts and alarms (legacy system)
* Current status of all grid tasks, including historical data
* Admin Node database usage
* Number of lost or missing objects
* Grid configuration settings
* NMS entities
* Active ILM policy
* Provisioned grid specification file
* Diagnostic metrics

You can enable the AutoSupport feature and the individual AutoSupport options when you first install StorageGRID, or you can enable them later. If AutoSupport is not enabled, a message appears on the Grid Manager Dashboard. The message includes a link to the AutoSupport configuration page.

If you close the message, it will not appear again until your browser cache is cleared, even if AutoSupport remains disabled.
