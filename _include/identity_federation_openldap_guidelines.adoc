//These are the shared steps for identity federation openldap guidelines in the tenant manager and the grid manager//


If you want to use an OpenLDAP server for identity federation, you must configure specific settings on the OpenLDAP server.

==== Memberof and refint overlays

The memberof and refint overlays should be enabled. For more information, see the instructions for reverse group membership maintenance in the Administrator's Guide for OpenLDAP.

==== Indexing

You must configure the following OpenLDAP attributes with the specified index keywords:

* `olcDbIndex: objectClass eq`
* `olcDbIndex: uid eq,pres,sub`
* `olcDbIndex: cn eq,pres,sub`
* `olcDbIndex: entryUUID eq`

In addition, ensure the fields mentioned in the help for Username are indexed for optimal performance.
