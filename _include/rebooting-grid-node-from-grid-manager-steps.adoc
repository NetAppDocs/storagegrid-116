NOTE: If you are rebooting the primary Admin Node, the confirmation dialog box reminds you that your browser's connection to the Grid Manager will be lost temporarily when services are stopped.

. Enter the provisioning passphrase, and click *OK*.
. Wait for the node to reboot.

It might take some time for services to shut down.

When the node is rebooting, the gray icon (Administratively Down) appears on the left side of the *Nodes* page. When all services have started again and the node is successfully connected to the grid, the *Nodes* page should display a normal status (no icons to the left of the node name), indicating that no alerts are active and the node is connected to the grid.
