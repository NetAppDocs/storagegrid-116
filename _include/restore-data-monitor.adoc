.Replicated data
--

* To determine if repairs are complete:
. Select *NODES* > *_Storage Node being repaired_* > *ILM*.
. Review the attributes in the Evaluation section. When repairs are complete, the *Awaiting - All* attribute indicates 0 objects.

* To monitor the repair in more detail:
. Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*.
. Select *_grid_* > *_Storage Node being repaired_* > *LDR* > *Data Store*.
. Use a combination of the following attributes to determine, as well as possible, if replicated repairs are complete.
+
NOTE: Cassandra inconsistencies might be present, and failed repairs are not tracked.

  ** *Repairs Attempted (XRPA)*: Use this attribute to track the progress of replicated repairs. This attribute increases each time a Storage Node tries to repair a high-risk object. When this attribute does not increase for a period longer than the current scan period (provided by the *Scan Period -- Estimated* attribute), it means that ILM scanning found no high-risk objects that need to be repaired on any nodes.
+
NOTE: High-risk objects are objects that are at risk of being completely lost. This does not include objects that do not satisfy their ILM configuration.

  ** *Scan Period -- Estimated (XSCM)*: Use this attribute to estimate when a policy change will be applied to previously ingested objects. If the *Repairs Attempted* attribute does not increase for a period longer than the current scan period, it is probable that replicated repairs are done. Note that the scan period can change. The *Scan Period -- Estimated (XSCM)* attribute applies to the entire grid and is the maximum of all node scan periods. You can query the *Scan Period -- Estimated* attribute history for the grid to determine an appropriate time frame.
  
* Optionally, to get an estimated percent completion for the replicated repair, add the `show-replicated-repair-status` option to the repair-data command.
+
`repair-data show-replicated-repair-status`
+
IMPORTANT: The `show-replicated-repair-status` option is available for technical preview in StorageGRID 11.6. This feature is under development, and the value returned might be incorrect or delayed. To determine if a repair is complete, use *Awaiting â€“ All*, *Repairs Attempted (XRPA)*, and *Scan Period -- Estimated (XSCM)* as described in xref:..//maintain/restoring-object-data-to-storage-volume-where-system-drive-is-intact.adoc[Monitor repairs].

.Erasure coded (EC) data
--

To monitor the repair of erasure-coded data and retry any requests that might have failed:

. Determine the status of erasure-coded data repairs:

** Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Metrics* to view the estimated time to completion and the completion percentage for the current job. Then, select *EC Overview* in the Grafana section. Look at the *Grid EC Job Estimated Time to Completion* and *Grid EC Job Percentage Completed* dashboards.
 
** Use this command to see the status of a specific `repair-data` operation:
+
`repair-data show-ec-repair-status --repair-id repair ID`

** Use this command to list all repairs:
+
`repair-data show-ec-repair-status`
+
The output lists information, including `repair ID`, for all previously and currently running repairs.

. If the output shows that the repair operation failed, use the `--repair-id` option to retry the repair.
+
This command retries a failed node repair, using the repair ID 6949309319275667690:
+
`repair-data start-ec-node-repair --repair-id 6949309319275667690`
+
This command retries a failed volume repair, using the repair ID 6949309319275667690:
+
`repair-data start-ec-volume-repair --repair-id 6949309319275667690`
