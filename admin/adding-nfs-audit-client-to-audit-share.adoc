NFS audit clients are granted access to an audit share based on their IP address. Grant access to the audit share to a new NFS audit client by adding its IP address to the audit share.

.What you'll need

* You have the `Passwords.txt` file with the root/admin account password (available in the SAID package).
* You  have the `Configuration.txt` file (available in the SAID package).
* The audit client is using NFS Version 3 (NFSv3).

.Steps

. Log in to the primary Admin Node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_primary_Admin_Node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Start the NFS configuration utility: `config_nfs.rb`

. Enter: `add-ip-to-share`
+
A list of NFS audit shares enabled on the Admin Node is displayed. The audit share is listed as: `/var/local/audit/export`

. Enter the number of the audit share: `_audit_share_number_`
. When prompted, enter the audit client's IP address or IP address range for the audit share: `_client_IP_address_`
+
The audit client is added to the audit share.

. When prompted, press *Enter*.
+
The NFS configuration utility is displayed.

. Repeat the steps for each audit client that should be added to the audit share.
. Optionally, verify your configuration: `validate-config`
+
The services are checked and displayed.

 .. When prompted, press *Enter*.
+
The NFS configuration utility is displayed.

. Close the NFS configuration utility: `exit`
. If the StorageGRID deployment is a single site, go to the next step.
+
Otherwise, if the StorageGRID deployment includes Admin Nodes at other sites, optionally enable these audit shares as required:

 .. Remotely log in to a site's Admin Node:
  ... Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
  ... Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Repeat these steps to configure the audit shares for each Admin Node.
 .. Close the remote secure shell login to the remote Admin Node: `exit`

. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
