You can configure an Archive Node to connect directly to Amazon Web Services (AWS) or to any other system that can interface to the StorageGRID system through the S3 API.

IMPORTANT: Moving objects from an Archive Node to an external archival storage system through the S3 API has been replaced by ILM Cloud Storage Pools, which offer more functionality. The *Cloud Tiering - Simple Storage Service (S3)* option is still supported, but you might prefer to implement Cloud Storage Pools instead.

If you are currently using an Archive Node with the *Cloud Tiering - Simple Storage Service (S3)* option, consider migrating your objects to a Cloud Storage Pool. See the instructions for xref:../ilm/index.adoc[managing objects with ILM].
