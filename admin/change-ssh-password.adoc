Each node in your grid has a unique node console password, which you need to log in to the node. Use these steps to change each unique node console password for each node in your grid.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Maintenance or Root Access permission.
* You have the current provisioning passphrase.

.About this task

Use the node console password to log in to a node as “admin” via SSH, or to the root user on a VM/physical console connection. The change node console password process creates new passwords for each node in your grid and stores the passwords in an updated `Passwords.txt` file in the recovery package.

NOTE: There are separate SSH access passwords for the SSH keys used for communication between nodes. The SSH access passwords are not changed by this procedure.

. Copy the downloaded Recovery Package file (.zip) to two safe, secure, and separate locations.

[start=3]
. When the download completes:
 .. Open the .zip file.
 .. Extract the contents of the .zip file.
 .. Confirm you can open the `Passwords.txt` file and that the contents are readable.
. Copy the downloaded new Recovery Package file (.zip) to two safe, secure, and separate locations. Do not overwrite the old recovery package.

*IMPORTANT*: You should either just view the `Passwords.txt` file, or if that is not possible, delete the extracted `Passwords.txt` file before copying the Recovery Package to the two separate secure locations.

*IMPORTANT*: The Recovery Package file must be secured because it contains encryption keys and passwords that can be used to obtain data from the StorageGRID system.

[start=5]
. Select the check box to indicate you have downloaded the new recovery package and verified the content.
