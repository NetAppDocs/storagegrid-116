Each node in your grid has a unique SSH password, which you need to log into the node. Use these steps to change the SSH password for each node in your grid.

.What you'll need

* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web_browser_requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You must have Maintenance or Root Access permissions.
* You must have the current provisioning passphrase.

.About this task

Use the SSH password to log into a node as “admin” via SSH, or to the root user on a VM/physical console connection. The change SSH password process creates new passwords for each node in your grid and stores the passwords in an updated recovery package.

There are three parts to the process:

.steps
. Provide provisioning passphrase
. Download the current recovery package
. Change SSH Passwords

CAUTION: After you have changed the SSH passwords, you must download the updated recovery package with the new passwords.

.Steps
. Select *Configuration* > *Security* > *Grid Passwords*.
