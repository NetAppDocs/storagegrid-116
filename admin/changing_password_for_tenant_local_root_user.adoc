You might need to change the password for a tenant's local root user if the root user is locked out of the account.

.What you'll need
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.
* You must have specific access permissions.

.About this task

If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for your StorageGRID system, the local root user cannot sign in to the tenant account. To perform root user tasks, users must belong to a federated group that has the Root Access permission for the tenant.

.Steps
. Select *Tenants*.
+
The Tenant Accounts page appears and lists all existing tenant accounts.
