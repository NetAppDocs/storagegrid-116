If you are a local user of the Grid Manager, you can change your own password.

You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.

If you sign in to StorageGRID as a federated user or if single sign-on (SSO) is enabled, you cannot change your password in Grid Manager. Instead, you must change your password in the external identity source, for example, Active Directory or OpenLDAP.

. From the Grid Manager header, select *your name* > *Change password*.
. Enter your current password.
. Type a new password.
+
Your password must contain at least 8 and no more than 32 characters. Passwords are case-sensitive.

. Re-enter the new password.
. Click *Save*.
