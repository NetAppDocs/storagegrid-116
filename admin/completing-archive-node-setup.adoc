The Archive Node is not functional after you complete the installation process. Before the StorageGRID system can save objects to the TSM Archive Node, you must complete the installation and configuration of the TSM server and configure the Archive Node to communicate with the TSM server.

Refer to the following IBM documentation, as necessary, as you prepare your TSM server for integration with the Archive Node in a StorageGRID system:
