When you are sizing and configuring your TSM server there are best practices you should apply to optimize it to work with the Archive Node.

When sizing and configuring the TSM server, you should consider the following factors:

* Because the Archive Node does not aggregate objects before saving them to the TSM server, the TSM database must be sized to hold references to all objects that will be written to the Archive Node.
* Archive Node software cannot tolerate the latency involved in writing objects directly to tape or other removable media. Therefore, the TSM server must be configured with a disk storage pool for the initial storage of data saved by the Archive Node whenever removable media are used.
* You must configure TSM retention policies to use event‚Äêbased retention. The Archive Node does not support creation-based TSM retention policies. Use the following recommended settings of retmin=0 and retver=0 in the retention policy (which indicates that retention begins when the Archive Node triggers a retention event, and is retained for 0 days after that). However, these values for retmin and retver are optional.

The disk pool must be configured to migrate data to the tape pool (that is, the tape pool must be the NXTSTGPOOL of the disk pool). The tape pool must not be configured as a copy pool of the disk pool with simultaneous write to both pools (that is, the tape pool cannot be a COPYSTGPOOL for the disk pool). To create offline copies of the tapes containing Archive Node data, configure the TSM server with a second tape pool that is a copy pool of the tape pool used for Archive Node data.
