|===
| Configuration| Advantages| Disadvantages

|Active-Backup HA
|
* Managed by StorageGRID with no external dependencies.
* Fast failover.

|
* Only one node in an HA group is active. At least one node per HA group will be idle.

|DNS Round Robin
|
* Increased aggregate throughput.
* No idle hosts.

|
* Slow failover, which could depend on client behavior.
* Requires configuration of hardware outside of StorageGRID.
* Needs a customer-implemented health check.

|Active-Active HA
|
* Traffic is distributed across multiple HA groups.
* High aggregate throughput that scales with the number of HA groups.
* Fast failover.

|
* More complex to configure.
* Requires configuration of hardware outside of StorageGRID.
* Needs a customer-implemented health check.
