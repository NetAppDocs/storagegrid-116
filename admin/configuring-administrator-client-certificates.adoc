[.lead]
Client certificates allow authorized external clients to access the StorageGRID Prometheus database, providing a secure way for external tools to monitor StorageGRID.

If you need to access StorageGRID using an external monitoring tool, you must upload or generate a client certificate using the Grid Manager and copy the certificate information to the external tool.

See the information about xref:using-storagegrid-security-certificates.adoc[general security certificate use] and xref:configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-grid-manager-tenant-manager.adoc[configuring custom server certificates]. 

NOTE: To ensure that operations are not disrupted by a failed server certificate, the *Expiration of client certificates configured on the Certificates page* alert is triggered when this server certificate is about to expire. As required, you can view when the current certificate expires by selecting *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and looking at the Expiration date for the client certificate on the Client tab.

NOTE: If you are using a key management server (KMS) to protect the data on specially configured appliance nodes, see the specific information about xref:kms-adding.adoc[uploading a KMS client certificate].

.What you'll need

* You have Root access permission.
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* To configure a client certificate:
** You have the IP address or domain name of the Admin Node.
** If you have configured the StorageGRID management interface certificate, you have the CA, client certificate, and private key used to configure the management interface certificate.
** To upload your own certificate, the private key for the certificate is available on your local computer.
** The private key must have been saved or recorded at the time it was created. If you do not have the original private key, you must create a new one.
* To edit a client certificate:
** You have the IP address or domain name of the Admin Node.
** To upload your own certificate or a new certificate, the private key, client certificate, and CA (if used) are available on your local computer.

== Add client certificates

Follow the procedure for your scenario to add a client certificate:

* <<Management interface certificate already configured>>
* <<CA issued client certificate>>
* <<Generated certificate from Grid Manager>>

=== Management interface certificate already configured

Use this procedure to add a client certificate if a management interface certificate is already configured using a customer-supplied CA, client certificate, and private key. 

.Steps

. In the Grid Manager, select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and then select the *Client* tab.
. Select *Add*.
. Enter a certificate name that contains at least 1 and no more than 32 characters.
. To access Prometheus metrics using your external monitoring tool, select *Allow Prometheus*.
. In the *Certificate type* section, upload the management interface certificate `.pem` file.

.. Select *Upload certificate* and then select *Continue*.
.. Upload the management interface certificate file (`.pem`).
+
* Select *Client certificate details* to display the certificate metadata and certificate PEM.
* Select *Copy certificate PEM* to copy the certificate contents for pasting elsewhere.

.. Select *Create* to save the certificate in the Grid Manager.
+
The new certificate appears on the Client tab.

. Configure the following settings on your external monitoring tool, such as Grafana.
+
// A Grafana example is shown in the following screenshot:
// +
// image::../media/grafana_add_url_and_auth.png[Grafana - Add URL and Auth]

 .. *Name*: Enter a name for the connection.
+
StorageGRID does not require this information, but you must provide a name to test the connection.

 .. *URL*: Enter the domain name or IP address for the Admin Node. Specify HTTPS and port 9091.
+
For example: `+https://admin-node.example.com:9091+`

 .. Enable *TLS Client Auth* and *With CA Cert*.

 .. Under TLS/SSL Auth Details, copy and paste: +
 * The management interface CA certificate to **CA Cert**
 * The client certificate to **Client Cert**
 * The private key to **Client Key**

 .. *ServerName*: Enter the domain name of the Admin Node.
+
ServerName must match the domain name as it appears in the management interface certificate.

 .. Save and test the certificate and private key that you copied from StorageGRID or a local file.
+
You can now access the Prometheus metrics from StorageGRID with your external monitoring tool.
+
For information about the metrics, see the xref:../monitor/index.adoc[instructions for monitoring StorageGRID].

=== CA issued client certificate

Use this procedure to add an administrator client certificate if a management interface certificate was not configured and you plan to add a client certificate for Prometheus that uses a CA issued client certificate and private key.

.Steps

. Perform the steps to xref:configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-grid-manager-tenant-manager.adoc[configure a management interface certificate].
. In the Grid Manager, select *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and then select the *Client* tab.
. Select *Add*.
. Enter a certificate name that contains at least 1 and no more than 32 characters.
. To access Prometheus metrics using your external monitoring tool, select *Allow Prometheus*.
. In the *Certificate type* section, upload the client certificate, private key and CA bundle `.pem` files:

.. Select *Upload certificate* and then select *Continue*.
.. Upload client certificate, private key and CA bundle files (`.pem`).
+
* Select *Client certificate details* to display the certificate metadata and certificate PEM.
* Select *Copy certificate PEM* to copy the certificate contents for pasting elsewhere.

.. Select *Create* to save the certificate in the Grid Manager.
+
The new certificates appear on the Client tab.


. Configure the following settings on your external monitoring tool, such as Grafana.
+
// A Grafana example is shown in the following screenshot:
// +
// image::../media/grafana_add_url_and_auth.png[Grafana - Add URL and Auth]

 .. *Name*: Enter a name for the connection.
+
StorageGRID does not require this information, but you must provide a name to test the connection.

 .. *URL*: Enter the domain name or IP address for the Admin Node. Specify HTTPS and port 9091.
+
For example: `+https://admin-node.example.com:9091+`

 .. Enable *TLS Client Auth* and *With CA Cert*.

 .. Under TLS/SSL Auth Details, copy and paste: +
 * The management interface CA certificate to **CA Cert**
 * The client certificate to **Client Cert**
 * The private key to **Client Key**


 .. *ServerName*: Enter the domain name of the Admin Node.
+
ServerName must match the domain name as it appears in the management interface certificate.

+
For information about the metrics, see the xref:../monitor/index.adoc[instructions for monitoring StorageGRID].

=== Generated certificate from Grid Manager

Use this procedure to add an administrator client certificate if a management interface certificate was not configured and you plan to add a client certificate for Prometheus that uses the generate certificate function in Grid Manager.

.Steps
