[.lead]
Client certificates allow authorized external clients to access the StorageGRID Prometheus database, providing a secure way for external tools to monitor StorageGRID.

If you need to access StorageGRID using an external monitoring tool, you must upload or generate an administrator client certificate using the Grid Manager and copy the certificate information to the external tool.

See the information about xref:using-storagegrid-security-certificates.adoc[general security certificate use] and xref:configuring-custom-server-certificate-for-grid-manager-tenant-manager.adoc[configuring custom server certificates]. 

NOTE: To ensure that operations are not disrupted by a failed server certificate, the *Expiration of client certificates configured on the Certificates page* alert is triggered when this server certificate is about to expire. As required, you can view when the current certificate expires by selecting *CONFIGURATION* > *Security* > *Certificates* and looking at the Expiration date for the client certificate on the Client tab.

NOTE: If you are using a key management server (KMS) to protect the data on specially configured appliance nodes, see the specific information about xref:kms-adding.adoc[uploading a KMS client certificate].

.What you'll need

* You have Root access permission.
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* To configure a client certificate:
** You have the IP address or domain name of the Admin Node.
** You have configured the StorageGRID management interface certificate and have the corresponding optional CA bundle.
** To upload your own certificate, the public key and private key for the certificate are available on your local computer.
* To edit a client certificate:
** You have the IP address or domain name of the Admin Node.
** To upload a new certificate and private key, the public key and private key for the certificate are available on your local computer.
