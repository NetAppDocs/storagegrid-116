[.lead]
Perform this procedure for each Admin Node in a StorageGRID deployment from which you want to retrieve audit messages.

.What you'll need
* You have the `Passwords.txt` file with the root/admin account password (available in the SAID package).
* You have the `Configuration.txt` file (available in the SAID package).

.About this task
Audit export through CIFS/Samba has been deprecated and will be removed in a future StorageGRID release.

.Steps
. Log in to the primary Admin Node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_primary_Admin_Node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Confirm that all services have a state of Running or Verified: `storagegrid-status`
+
If all services are not Running or Verified, resolve issues before continuing.

. Return to the command line, press *Ctrl*+*C*.
. Start the CIFS configuration utility: `config_cifs.rb`

. Set the authentication for the Windows Workgroup:
+
If authentication has already been set, an advisory message appears. If authentication has already been set, go to the next step.

 .. Enter: `set-authentication`
 .. When prompted for Windows Workgroup or Active Directory installation, enter: `workgroup`
 .. When prompted, enter a name of the Workgroup: `_workgroup_name_`
 .. When prompted, create a meaningful NetBIOS name: `_netbios_name_`
+
or
+
Press *Enter* to use the Admin Node's hostname as the NetBIOS name.
+
The script restarts the Samba server and changes are applied. This should take less than one minute. After setting authentication, add an audit client.

 .. When prompted, press *Enter*.
+
The CIFS configuration utility is displayed.

. Add an audit client:
 .. Enter: `add-audit-share`
+
NOTE: The share is automatically added as read-only.

 .. When prompted, add a user or group: `_user_`
 .. When prompted, enter the audit user name: `_audit_user_name_`
 .. When prompted, enter a password for the audit user: `_password_`
 .. When prompted, re-enter the same password to confirm it: `_password_`
 .. When prompted, press *Enter*.
+
The CIFS configuration utility is displayed.

+
NOTE: There is no need to enter a directory. The audit directory name is predefined.
. If more than one user or group is permitted to access the audit share, add the additional users:
 .. Enter: `add-user-to-share`
+
A numbered list of enabled shares is displayed.

 .. When prompted, enter the number of the audit-export share: `_share_number_`
 .. When prompted, add a user or group: `user`
+
or `group`

 .. When prompted, enter the name of the audit user or group: `_audit_user or audit_group_`
 .. When prompted, press *Enter*.
+
The CIFS configuration utility is displayed.

 .. Repeat these substeps for each additional user or group that has access to the audit share.
. Optionally, verify your configuration: `validate-config`
+
The services are checked and displayed. You can safely ignore the following messages:

The audit client configuration is displayed.

 .. When prompted, press *Enter*.
+
The CIFS configuration utility is displayed.

. Close the CIFS configuration utility: `exit`
. Start the Samba service: `service smbd start`
. If the StorageGRID deployment is a single site, go to the next step.
+
or
+
Optionally, if the StorageGRID deployment includes Admin Nodes at other sites, enable these audit share as required:

 .. Remotely log in to a site's Admin Node:
  ... Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
  ... Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Repeat the steps to configure the audit share for each additional Admin Node.
 .. Close the remote secure shell login to the remote Admin Node: `exit`

. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
