As a grid administrator, you manage the configuration options that control how S3 and Swift tenants can connect client applications to your StorageGRID system to store and retrieve data. There are a number of different options to meet different client and tenant requirements.

Client applications can store or retrieve objects by connecting to any of the following:

* The Load Balancer service on Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes, or optionally, the virtual IP address of a high availability (HA) group of Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes
* The CLB service on Gateway Nodes, or optionally, the virtual IP address of a high availability group of Gateway Nodes
+
NOTE: The CLB service is deprecated. Clients configured before the StorageGRID 11.3 release can continue to use the CLB service on Gateway Nodes. All other client applications that depend on StorageGRID to provide load balancing should connect using the Load Balancer service.

* Storage Nodes, with or without an external load balancer

You can optionally configure the following features on your StorageGRID system:

* *VLAN interfaces*: You can create virtual LAN (VLAN) interfaces on Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes to isolate and partition client and tenant traffic for security, flexibility, and performance. After creating a VLAN interface, you add it to a high availability (HA) group.

* *High availability groups*: You can create an HA group of the interfaces for Gateway Nodes or Admin Nodes to create an active-backup configuration, or you can use round-robin DNS or a third-party load balancer and multiple HA groups to achieve an active-active configuration. Client connections are made using the virtual IP addresses of HA groups.

* *Load Balancer service*: You can enable clients to use the Load Balancer service by creating load balancer endpoints for client connections. When creating a load balancer endpoint, you specify a port number, whether the endpoint accepts HTTP or HTTPS connections, the type of client (S3 or Swift) that will use the endpoint, and the certificate to be used for HTTPS connections (if applicable).

* *Untrusted Client Network*: You can make the Client Network more secure by configuring it as untrusted. When the Client Network is untrusted, clients can only connect using load balancer endpoints.


You can also enable the use of HTTP for clients that connect to StorageGRID either directly to Storage Nodes or using the CLB service (deprecated), and you can configure S3 API endpoint domain names for S3 clients.
