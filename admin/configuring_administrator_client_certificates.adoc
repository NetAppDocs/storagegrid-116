You can use client certificates to allow authorized external clients to access the StorageGRID Prometheus database. Client certificates provide a secure way to use external tools to monitor StorageGRID.

If you need to access StorageGRID using an external monitoring tool, you must upload or generate a client certificate using the Grid Manager and copy the certificate information to the external tool.
