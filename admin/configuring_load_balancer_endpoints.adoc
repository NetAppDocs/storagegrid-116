= Configure load balancer endpoints
:icons: font

[.lead]
You define load balancer endpoints to determine the ports and network protocols S3 and Swift clients can use when connecting to the StorageGRID load balancer service on Gateway and Admin Nodes.

.What you'll need

* You have the Root Access permission.
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.
* If you have previously remapped the port you intend to use for the load balancer endpoint, you have removed the port remap.
+
IMPORTANT: If you have remapped any ports, you cannot use the same ports to configure load balancer endpoints. You can create endpoints using remapped ports, but those endpoints will be remapped to the original CLB ports and service, not the Load Balancer service. Follow the steps in the xref:../maintain/index.adoc[Maintain & recover instructions] for removing port remaps.
+
NOTE: The CLB service is deprecated.


== Create a load balancer endpoint

Each load balancer endpoint specifies a port, a network protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), and a service type (S3 or Swift). If you create an HTTPS endpoint, you must upload or generate a server certificate.

.About this task

Before creating a load balancer endpoint, create any  xref:managing_high_availability_groups.adoc[high availability (HA) groups] you plan to use. Then, create the endpoint and provide clients with the port number, the virtual IP of the HA group (or the IP address of a Gateway or Admin Node), and any required certificate details.


.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *Load balancer endpoints*.

. Select *Create*.

. Enter details about the endpoint.
+
[cols="1a,1a" options="header"]
|===
| Field| Description

|Name
|A descriptive name to help you identify this endpoint. Must be between 1 and 64 characters.

|Port
|The port that S3 and Swift clients will use to connect to the load balancer service on Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes.

You can accept the suggested port number or enter any external port that is not used by another grid service.

If you enter *80* or *443*, the endpoint is configured only on Gateway Nodes. These ports are reserved on Admin Nodes.

*Note:* Ports used by other grid services are not permitted. See the xref:../network/index.adoc[Network guidelines] for a list of ports used for internal and external communications.

|Client type
|The type of client application that will use this endpoint. Must be S3 or Swift.

|Network protocol
|The network protocol that clients will use when connecting to this endpoint.

* Select *HTTPS* for secure, TLS encrypted communication. Then, attach the security certificate before saving the endpoint.
* Select *HTTP* for less secure, unencrypted communication. Use HTTP only for a non-production grid.

|===

. Select *Continue*.

. Select a binding mode for the endpoint.
+
The binding mode controls how the endpoint is accessed. You can use a non-global binding mode if you plan to monitor or limit the use of this endpoint with a traffic classification policy.

 ** *Global* (default): The endpoint is accessible on all Gateway Nodes and Admin Nodes on the specified port number.
+
 ** *Virtual IPs of HA Group*: The endpoint is accessible only through the virtual IP addresses defined for the selected HA groups. Endpoints defined in this mode can reuse the same port number, as long as the HA groups defined by those endpoints do not overlap with each other.
+
Select the HA groups with the virtual IP addresses where you want the endpoint to appear.
+

 ** *Node interfaces*: The endpoint is accessible only on the designated nodes and network interfaces. Endpoints defined in this mode can reuse the same port number as long as those interfaces do not overlap with each other.
+
Select the node interfaces where you want the endpoint to appear.
+
image::../media/load_balancer_endpoint_node_interfaces_binding_mode.png[Endpoint Node Interfaces Binding Mode]
. Select *Save*.
+
The Edit Endpoint dialog box appears.

. Select *S3* or *Swift* to specify the type of traffic this endpoint will serve.
+
image::../media/load_balancer_endpoint_client_options.png[Load Balancer Client]

. If you selected *HTTP*, select *Save*.
+
The unsecured endpoint is created. The table on the Load balancer endpoints page lists the endpoint's display name, port number, protocol, and endpoint ID.

. If you selected *HTTPS*, select *Continue*.
+
image::../media/load_balancer_endpoint_upload_cert.png[Upload Cert]

. Select the type of security certificate you will attach to the endpoint.
** *Use StorageGRID S3 and Swift Certificate*

** *Upload certificate*

** *Generate certificate*

 .. Browse for the server certificate and the certificate private key.
+
To enable S3 clients to connect using an S3 API endpoint domain name, use a multi-domain or wildcard certificate that matches all domain names that the client might use to connect to the grid. For example, the server certificate might use the domain name `*._example_.com`.
+
xref:configuring_s3_api_endpoint_domain_names.adoc[Configuring S3 API endpoint domain names]

 .. Optionally browse for a CA bundle.
 .. Select *Save*.
+
The PEM-encoded certificate data for the endpoint appears.

. If you selected *HTTPS* and you want to generate a certificate, select *Generate Certificate*.
+
image::../media/load_balancer_endpoint_generate_cert.png[Generate Cert]

 .. Enter a domain name or an IP address.
+
You can use wildcards to represent the fully qualified domain names of all Admin Nodes and Gateway Nodes running the Load Balancer service. For example, `*.sgws.foo.com` uses the * wildcard to represent `gn1.sgws.foo.com` and `gn2.sgws.foo.com`.
+
xref:configuring_s3_api_endpoint_domain_names.adoc[Configuring S3 API endpoint domain names]

 .. Select image:../media/icon_plus_sign_black_on_white.gif[Plus Sign] to add any other domain names or IP addresses.
+
If you are using high availability (HA) groups, add the domain names and IP addresses of the HA virtual IPs.

 .. Optionally, enter an X.509 subject, also referred to as the Distinguished Name (DN), to identify who owns the certificate.
 .. Optionally, select the number of days the certificate is valid. The default is 730 days.
 .. Select *Generate*.
+
The certificate metadata and the PEM-encoded certificate data for the endpoint appear.

. Click *Save*.
+
The endpoint is created. The table on the Load Balancer Endpoints page lists the endpoint's display name, port number, protocol, and endpoint ID.


== Editing load balancer endpoints

For an unsecured (HTTP) endpoint, you can change the endpoint service type between S3 and Swift. For a secured (HTTPS) endpoint, you can edit the endpoint service type and view or change the security certificate.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network settings* > *Load balancer endpoints*.
+
The Load balancer endpoints page appears. The existing endpoints are listed in the table.
+
Endpoints with certificates that will expire soon are identified in the table.
+
image::../media/load_balancer_endpoint_edit_or_remove.png[Edit Endpoint]

. Select the endpoint you want to edit.
. Click *Edit endpoint*.
+
The Edit Endpoint dialog box appears.
+
For an unsecured (HTTP) endpoint, only the Endpoint Service Configuration section of the dialog box appears. For a secured (HTTPS) endpoint, the Endpoint Service Configuration and the Certificates sections of the dialog box appear, as shown in the following example.
+
image::../media/load_balancer_endpoint_edit.png[Edit Load Balancer Endpoint]

. Make the desired changes to the endpoint.
+
For an unsecured (HTTP) endpoint, you can:

 ** Change the endpoint service type between S3 and Swift.
 ** Change the endpoint binding mode.
For a secured (HTTPS) endpoint, you can:
 ** Change the endpoint service type between S3 and Swift.
 ** Change the endpoint binding mode.
 ** View the security certificate.
 ** Upload or generate a new security certificate when the current certificate is expired or about to expire.
+
Select a tab to display detailed information about the default StorageGRID server certificate or a CA signed certificate that was uploaded.

+
NOTE: To change the protocol for an existing endpoint, for example from HTTP to HTTPS, you must create a new endpoint. Follow the instructions for <<creating load balancer endpoints>>, and select the desired protocol.

. Select *Save*.


== Removing load balancer endpoints

If you no longer need a load balancer endpoint, you can remove it.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network settings* > *Load balancer endpoints*.
+
The Load Balancer Endpoints page appears. The existing endpoints are listed in the table.
+
image::../media/load_balancer_endpoint_edit_or_remove.png[Edit Endpoint]

. Select the radio button to the left of the endpoint you want to remove.
. Select *Remove endpoint*.
+
A confirmation dialog box appears.
+
image::../media/load_balancer_endpoint_confirm_removal.png[Confirm Endpoint Removal]

. Select *OK*.
+
The endpoint is removed.
