.Steps

. If there are existing tenant accounts, confirm that none of the tenants is using its own identity source.
+
IMPORTANT: When you enable SSO, an identity source configured in the Tenant Manager is overridden by the identity source configured in the Grid Manager. Users belonging to the tenant's identity source will no longer be able to sign in unless they have an account with the Grid Manager identity source.

 .. Sign in to the Tenant Manager for each tenant account.
 .. Select *Access Control* > *Identity Federation*.
 .. Confirm that the *Enable Identity Federation* check box is not selected.
 .. If it is, confirm that any federated groups that might be in use for this tenant account are no longer required, unselect the check box, and click *Save*.

. Confirm that a federated user can access the Grid Manager:
 .. From Grid Manager, select *Configuration* > *Access Control* > *Admin Groups*.
 .. Ensure that at least one federated group has been imported from the Active Directory identity source and that it has been assigned the Root Access permission.
 .. Sign out.
 .. Confirm you can sign back in to the Grid Manager as a user in the federated group.
. If there are existing tenant accounts, confirm that a federated user who has Root Access permission can sign in:
 .. From the Grid Manager, select *Tenants*.
 .. Select the tenant account, and click *Edit Account*.
 .. If the *Uses Own Identity Source* check box is selected, uncheck the box and click *Save*.
