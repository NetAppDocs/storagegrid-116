You can select the Prevent Client Modification grid option to deny specific HTTP client operations.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.

.About this task
Prevent Client Modification is a system wide setting. When the Prevent Client Modification option is selected, the following requests are denied:

* *S3 REST API*
 ** Delete Bucket requests
 ** Any requests to modify an existing object's data, user-defined metadata, or S3 object tagging
+
NOTE: This setting does not apply to buckets with versioning enabled. Versioning already prevents modifications to object data, user-defined metadata, and object tagging.
* *Swift REST API*
 ** Delete Container requests
 ** Requests to modify any existing object. For example, the following operations are denied: Put Overwrite, Delete, Metadata Update, and so on.

.Steps
