[.lead]
You must create at least one tenant account to control access to the storage in your StorageGRID system.

When you create a tenant account, you specify a name, a client protocol, and optionally a storage quota. If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for StorageGRID, you also specify which federated group has Root access permission to configure the tenant account. If StorageGRID is not using single sign-on, you must also specify whether the tenant account will use its own identity source and configure the initial password for the tenant's local root user.

The Grid Manager provides a wizard that takes you through the steps for creating a tenant account. The steps vary based on whether xref:using-identity-federation.adoc[identity federation] and xref:configuring-sso.adoc[single sign-on] are configured and whether the Grid Manager account you use to create the tenant account belongs to an admin group with the Root access permission.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.
* If the tenant account will use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager, and you want to grant Root access permission for the tenant account to a federated group, you have imported that federated group into the Grid Manager. You do not need to assign any Grid Manager permissions to this admin group. See the xref:managing-admin-groups.adoc[instructions for managing admin groups].

.Steps

. Select *TENANTS*.
. Select *Create* and enter the following information for the tenant:
.. *Name*: Enter a name for the tenant account. Tenant names do not have to be unique. When the tenant account is created, it receives a unique, numeric account ID.
.. *Description* (optional): Enter a description that helps you identify the tenant.
.. *Client type*: Select the client type of either *S3* or *Swift*.
.. *Storage quota* (optional): If you want this tenant to have a storage quota, enter a numerical value for the quota and select the correct units (GB, TB, or PB).

When SSO is enabled for StorageGRID, the tenant must use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager. No local users can sign in. You specify which federated group has Root access permission to configure the tenant account.

.. Select an existing federated group from the Grid Manager to have the initial Root access permission for the tenant.
+
NOTE: If you have adequate permissions, the existing federated groups from the Grid Manager are listed when you select the field. Otherwise, enter the group's unique name.

.. Select *Create tenant*.

.SSO not enabled

.. Complete the steps described in the table depending on whether the tenant will manage its own groups and users or use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager.
