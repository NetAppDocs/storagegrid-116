[.lead]
You must create at least one tenant account to control access to the storage in your StorageGRID system.

When you create a tenant account, you specify a name, a client protocol, and optionally a storage quota. If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled for StorageGRID, you also specify which federated group has Root Access permission to configure the tenant account. If StorageGRID is not using single sign-on, you must also specify whether the tenant account will use its own identity source and configure the initial password for the tenant's local root user.

The Grid Manager provides a wizard that takes you through the steps for creating a tenant account. The steps vary based on whether a xref:using-identity-federation.adoc[federated identity source] and xref:using-single-sign-on.adoc[single sign-on] are configured and whether the Grid Manager account you use to create the tenant account belongs to an admin group with the Root Access permission.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.
* If the tenant account will use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager, and you want to grant Root Access permission for the tenant account to a federated group, you must have imported that federated group into the Grid Manager. You do not need to assign any Grid Manager permissions to this admin group. See the xref:managing-admin-groups.adoc[instructions for managing admin groups].

.Steps

. Select *TENANTS*.
. Select *Create* and enter the following information for the tenant:
.. *Name*: Enter a name for the tenant account. Tenant names do not have to be unique. When the tenant account is created, it receives a unique, numeric account ID.
.. *Description* (optional): Enter a description that helps you identify the tenant.
.. *Client type*: Select the client type of either *S3* or *Swift*.
.. *Storage quota* (optional): If you want this tenant to have a storage quota, enter a numerical value for the quota and select the correct units (GB, TB, or PB).
+

.SSO enabled

When SSO is enabled for StorageGRID, the tenant must use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager. No local users can sign in. You also specify which federated group has Root Access permission to configure the tenant account.

.. To define root access for the tenant account, do one or both of the following:

* Select an existing federated group from the Grid Manager to have the initial Root Access permission for the tenant.
+
NOTE: If you have adequate permissions, the existing federated groups from the Grid Manager are listed when you select the field. Otherwise, enter the group's unique name.
+
* Enter the local root user's credentials.

.. If you are a user in the Root Access group, optionally select *Sign in as root* to immediately access the Tenant Manager, where you can configure the tenant. Otherwise, provide the URL for the Sign in link to the tenant accountâ€™s administrator. The URL for a tenant is the fully qualified domain name or IP address of any Admin Node, followed by `/?accountId=20-digit-account-id`.
+
NOTE: An access denied message is displayed if you select *Sign in as root* and you do not belong to the Root Access group for the tenant account.

.SSO not enabled

.. Complete the steps described in the table depending on whether the tenant will use the identity source that was configured for the Grid Manager.

|Select *Restricted* to learn more about accessing this tenant account.

The URL for the Tenant Manager has this format:

`https://_FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP:port_/?accountId=_20-digit-account-id_/`

 ** `_FQDN_or_Admin_Node_IP_` is a fully qualified domain name or the IP address of an Admin Node
 ** `_port_` is the tenant-only port
 ** `_20-digit-account-id_` is the tenant's unique account ID

|Accessing the Grid Manager on port 443 but you did not set a password for the local root user
|In the Grid Manager, select *Sign in as root*, and enter the credentials for a user in the Root Access federated group.

|Accessing the Grid Manager on port 443 and you set a password for the local root user
|Go to the next step to <<STEP_SIGN_IN_AS_ROOT,sign in as root>>.

A green check mark appears next to the button, indicating that you are now signed in the tenant account as the root user. In addition, links for configuring buckets or containers, groups, and users appear.
