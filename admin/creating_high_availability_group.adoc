[.lead]
You can create one or more high availability (HA) groups to provide highly available access to the services on Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web_browser_requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root Access permission.

.About this task

An interface must meet the following conditions to be included in an HA group:

* The interface must be for a Gateway Node or an Admin Node.
* The interface must belong to the Grid Network (eth0) or the Client Network (eth2).
* The interface must be configured with fixed or static IP addressing, not with DHCP.

== Access the wizard

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *High availability groups*.

. Select *Create*.

== Enter details

. Type a name for the HA group.

. Optionally, enter a description for the HA group.

. Select *Continue*.

== Add Interfaces

. Select one or more interfaces to add to this HA group.

+
An interface does not appear in the list if its IP address is assigned by DHCP.
+
.Guidelines for selecting interfaces

 * You must select at least one interface.
 * You can select only one interface for a node.
 * If you select more than one interface, all of the interfaces must be on either the Grid Network (eth0) or on the Client Network (eth2).
 ** All interfaces must be in the same subnet or in subnets with a common prefix.
+
IP addresses will be restricted to the smallest subnet (the one with the largest prefix).

 * If you select interfaces on different types of nodes, and a failover occurs, only the services common to the selected nodes will be available on the virtual IPs.
  ** Select two or more Admin Nodes for HA protection of the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager.
  ** Select two or more Admin Nodes, Gateway Nodes, or both for HA protection of the Load Balancer service.
  ** Select two or more Gateway Nodes for HA protection of the (deprecated) CLB service.

. Select *Continue*.

== Determine the failover order



. Drag and drop the rows or select the arrows to determine the failover order of the interfaces you selected.
+
image::../media/ha_group_select_virtual_ips.png[HA Groups Select Virtual IPs]
+
The first interface in the list is the active interface. If a failure occurs, the VIP addresses are reassigned the next interface in the list.
+
NOTE: If the HA group provides access to the Grid Manager, you must select an interface on the primary Admin Node to be the active interface. Some maintenance procedures can only be performed from the primary Admin Node.

. Select *Continue*.

== Enter IP addresses

. Enter gateway CIDR.

. Enter virtual IP addresses for the HA group. Select *Add another IP address* to add up to 10 IP addresses.
+
You must provide at least one IPv4 address. Optionally, you can specify additional IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
+
IPv4 addresses must be within the IPv4 subnet shared by all of the member interfaces.

. Select *Create HA group*.
+
The HA Group is created, and you can now use the configured virtual IP addresses.
