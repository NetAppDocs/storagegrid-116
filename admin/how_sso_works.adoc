[.lead]
Before enabling single sign-on (SSO), review how the StorageGRID sign-in and sign-out processes are affected when SSO is enabled.

== Signing in when SSO is enabled

[.lead]
When SSO is enabled and you sign in to StorageGRID, you are redirected to your organization's SSO page to validate your credentials.

. Enter the fully qualified domain name or IP address of any StorageGRID Admin Node in a web browser.
+
The StorageGRID Sign in page appears.

 ** If this is the first time you have accessed the URL on this browser, you are prompted for an account ID:
+

 ** If you have previously accessed either the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager, you are prompted to select a recent account or to enter an account ID:
+

+
NOTE: The StorageGRID Sign in page is not shown when you enter the complete URL for a tenant account (that is, a fully qualified domain name or IP address followed by /?accountId=20-digit-account-id). Instead, you are immediately redirected to your organization's SSO sign-in page. Go to step link:how_sso_works.md#STEP_DE77F987631F432F949A50143988EEAF[how_sso_works.md#STEP_DE77F987631F432F949A50143988EEAF].

. Indicate whether you want to access the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager:
 ** To access the Grid Manager, leave the**Account ID** field blank, enter *0* as the account ID, or select *Grid Manager* if it appears in the list of recent accounts.
 ** To access the Tenant Manager, enter the 20-digit tenant account ID or select a tenant by name if it appears in the list of recent accounts.
. Click *Sign in*
+
StorageGRID redirects you to your organization's SSO sign-in page. For example:
+

. Sign in with your SSO credentials.
+
If your SSO credentials are correct:

 .. The identity provider (IdP) provides an authentication response to StorageGRID.
 .. StorageGRID validates the authentication response.
 .. If the response is valid and you belong to a federated group that has adequate access permission, you are signed in to the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager, depending on which account you selected.

. Optionally, access other Admin Nodes, or access the Grid Manager or the Tenant Manager, if you have adequate permissions.
+
You do not need to reenter your SSO credentials.

== Signing out when SSO is enabled

[.lead]
When SSO is enabled for StorageGRID, what happens when you sign out depends on what you are signed in to and where you are signing out from.

. Locate the *Sign Out* link in the top-right corner of the user interface.
. Click *Sign Out*.
+
The StorageGRID Sign in page appears. The *Recent Accounts* drop-down is updated to include *Grid Manager* or the name of the tenant, so you can access these user interfaces more quickly in the future.
