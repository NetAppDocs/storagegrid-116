A StorageGRID system is designed to provide efficient operation for object storage and retrieval, and to provide excellent protection against data loss through the seamless creation of redundant copies of object data and metadata.

However, data migration must be carefully managed according to the instructions in this chapter to avoid having an impact on day-to-day system operations, or, in extreme cases, placing data at risk of loss in case of a failure in the StorageGRID system.

Migration of large quantities of data places additional load on the system. When the StorageGRID system is heavily loaded, it responds more slowly to requests to store and retrieve objects. This can interfere with store and retrieve requests which are integral to day-to-day operations. Migration can also cause other operational issues. For example, when a Storage Node is nearing capacity, the heavy intermittent load due to batch ingest can cause the Storage Node to cycle between read-only and read-write, generating notifications.

If the heavy loading persists, queues can develop for various operations that the StorageGRID system must perform to ensure full redundancy of object data and metadata.

Data migration must be carefully managed according to the guidelines in this document to ensure safe and efficient operation of the StorageGRID system during migration. When migrating data, ingest objects in batches or continuously throttle ingest. Then, continuously monitor the StorageGRID system to ensure that various attribute values are not exceeded.
