[.lead]
The Swagger user interface provides complete details and documentation for each API operation.

.What you'll need
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web_browser_requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You must have specific access permissions.

IMPORTANT: Any API operations you perform using the API Docs webpage are live operations. Be careful not to create, update, or delete configuration data or other data by mistake.

.Steps
. Select *Help* > *API Documentation* from the Grid Manager header.
. Select the desired operation.
+
When you expand an API operation, you can see the available HTTP actions, such as GET, PUT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

. Select an HTTP action to see the request details, including the endpoint URL, a list of any required or optional parameters, an example of the request body (when required), and the possible responses.

. Determine if the request requires additional parameters, such as a group or user ID. Then, obtain these values. You might need to issue a different API request first to get the information you need.
. Determine if you need to modify the example request body. If so, you can click *Model* to learn the requirements for each field.
. Click *Try it out*.
. Provide any required parameters, or modify the request body as required.
. Click *Execute*.
. Review the response code to determine if the request was successful.
