Key UID
a|
The unique ID of the encryption key used to encrypt and decrypt data on the appliance node. To view an entire key UID, hover your cursor over the cell.

A dash (--) indicates the key UID is unknown, possibly because of a connection issue between the appliance node and the KMS.
a|
Status
a|
The status of the connection between the KMS and the appliance node. If the node is connected, the timestamp updates every 30 minutes. It can take several minutes for the connection status to update after the KMS configuration changes.

*Note:* You must refresh your web browser to see the new values.

. If the Status column indicates a KMS issue, address the issue immediately.
+
During normal KMS operations, the status will be *Connected to KMS*. If a node is disconnected from the grid, the node connection state is shown (Administratively Down or Unknown).
+
Other status messages correspond to StorageGRID alerts with the same names:

 ** KMS configuration failed to load
 ** KMS connectivity error
 ** KMS encryption key name not found
 ** KMS encryption key rotation failed
 ** KMS key failed to decrypt an appliance volume
 ** KMS is not configured
See the recommended actions for these alerts in the instructions for monitoring and troubleshooting StorageGRID.
