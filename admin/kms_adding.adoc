[.lead]
You use the StorageGRID Key Management Server wizard to add each KMS or KMS cluster.

.What you'll need

* You must have reviewed the xref:kms_considerations_and_requirements.adoc[considerations and requirements for using a key management server].

* You must have xref:kms_configuring_storagegrid_as_client.adoc[configured StorageGRID as a client in the KMS], and you must have the required information for each KMS or KMS cluster

* You must have the Root Access permission.
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web_browser_requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

.About this task

If possible, configure any site-specific key management servers before configuring a default KMS that applies to all sites not managed by another KMS. If you create the default KMS first, all node-encrypted appliances in the grid will be encrypted by the default KMS. If you want to create a site-specific KMS later, you must first copy the current version of the encryption key from the default KMS to the new KMS.
