[.lead]
You can create admin groups to manage the security permissions for one or more admin users. Users must belong to a group to be granted access to the StorageGRID system.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

* You have specific access permissions.

* If you plan to import a federated group, you have configured identity federation and the federated group already exists in the configured identity source.

== Create an admin group

Admin groups allow you to determine which users can access which features and operations in the Grid Manager and the Grid Management API.

=== Access the wizard

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Access control* > *Admin groups*.

. Select *Create group*.

=== Choose a group type

You can create a local group or import a federated group.

** Create a local group if you want to assign permissions to local users.
** Create a federated group to import users from the identity source.

.Local group
--

. Select *Local group*.
. Enter a display name for the group, which you can update later as required. For example, "`Maintenance Users`" or "`ILM Administrators.`"
. Enter a unique name for the group, which you cannot update later. 

. Select *Continue*. 
--
//end local, begin federated

.Federated group
--

. Select *Federated group*.
. Enter the name of the group you want to import, exactly as it appears in the configured identity source. 

** For Active Directory and Azure, use the sAMAccountName.
** For OpenLDAP, use the CN (Common Name).
** For another LDAP, use the appropriate unique name for the LDAP server.

. Select *Continue*.

====
//end tabbed blocks


=== Manage group permissions

. For *Access mode*, select whether users in the group can change settings and perform operations in the Grid Manager and the Grid Management API or whether they can only view settings and features.
 ** *Read-write* (default): Users can change settings and perform the operations allowed by their management permissions.
 ** *Read-only*: Users can only view settings and features. They cannot make any changes or perform any operations in the Grid Manager or Grid Management API. Local read-only users can change their own passwords.
+
NOTE: If a user belongs to multiple groups and any group is set to *Read-only*, the user will have read-only access to all selected settings and features.

. Select one or more <<Group permissions>>.
+
You must assign at least one permission to each group; otherwise, users belonging to the group will not be able to sign in to StorageGRID.

. If you are creating a local group, select *Continue*. If you are creating a federated group, select *Create group* and *Finish*.

=== Add users (local groups only)

. Optionally, select one or more local users for this group.
+
If you have not yet created local users, you can save the group without adding users. You can add this group to the user on the Users page. See 
xref:managing-users.adoc[Manage users] for details.

. Select *Create group* and *Finish*.

== View and edit admin groups

You can view details for existing groups, modify a group, or duplicate a group.

* To view basic information for all groups, review the table on the Groups page. 

* To view all details for a specific group or to edit a group, use the *Actions* menu or the details page.

You can delete an admin group when you want to remove the group from the system, and remove all permissions associated with the group. Deleting an admin group removes any users from the group, but does not delete the users.

. From the Groups page, select the check box for each group you want to remove. 
. Select *Actions* > *Delete group*.
. Select *Delete groups*.


== Group permissions

When creating admin user groups, you select one or more permissions to control access to specific features of the Grid Manager. You can then assign each user to one or more of these admin groups to determine which tasks that user can perform.

You must assign at least one permission to each group; otherwise, users belonging to that group will not be able to sign in to the Grid Manager or the Grid Management API.

By default, any user who belongs to a group that has at least one permission can perform the following tasks:

* Sign in to the Grid Manager
* View the Dashboard
* View the Nodes pages
* Monitor grid topology
* View current and resolved alerts
* View current and historical alarms (legacy system)
* Change their own password (local users only)
* View certain information on the Configuration and Maintenance pages

=== Interaction between permissions and Access mode

For all permissions, the group's *Access mode* setting determines whether users can change settings and perform operations or whether they can only view the related settings and features. If a user belongs to multiple groups and any group is set to *Read-only*, the user will have read-only access to all selected settings and features.

The following sections describe the permissions you can assign when creating or editing an admin group. Any functionality not explicitly mentioned requires the *Root access* permission.

=== Root access

This permission provides access to all grid administration features.

=== Acknowledge alarms (legacy)

This permission provides access to acknowledge and respond to alarms (legacy system). All signed-in users can view current and historical alarms.

If you want a user to monitor grid topology and acknowledge alarms only, you should assign this permission.

=== Change tenant root password

This permission provides access to the *Change root password* option on the Tenants page, allowing you to control who can change the password for the tenant's local root user. This permission is also used for migrating S3 keys when the S3 key import feature is enabled. Users who do not have this permission cannot see the *Change root password* option.

NOTE: To grant access to the Tenants page, which contains the *Change root password* option, also assign the *Tenant accounts* permission.

=== Grid topology page configuration

This permission provides access to the Configuration tabs on the *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology* page.

=== ILM

This permission provides access to the following *ILM* menu options:

* Rules
* Policies
* Erasure coding
* Regions
* Storage pools

NOTE: Users must have the *Other grid configuration* and *Grid topology page configuration* permissions to manage storage grades.

* *CONFIGURATION* > *Access control*:
** Grid passwords

* *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks*:
 ** Decommission
