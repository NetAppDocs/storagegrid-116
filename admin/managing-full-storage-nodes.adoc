As Storage Nodes reach capacity, you must expand the StorageGRID system through the addition of new storage. There are three options available: adding storage volumes, adding storage expansion shelves, and adding Storage Nodes.

== Add storage volumes

Each Storage Node supports a maximum number of storage volumes. The defined maximum varies by platform. If a Storage Node contains fewer than the maximum number of storage volumes, you can add volumes to increase its capacity. See the instructions for xref:../expand/index.adoc[expanding a StorageGRID system].

== Add storage expansion shelves

Some StorageGRID appliance Storage Nodes, such as the SG6060, can support additional storage shelves. If you have StorageGRID appliances with expansion capabilities that have not already been expanded to maximum capacity, you can add storage shelves to increase capacity. See the instructions for xref:../expand/index.adoc[expanding a StorageGRID system].

== Add Storage Nodes

You can increase storage capacity by adding Storage Nodes. Careful consideration of currently active ILM rules and capacity requirements must be taken when adding storage. See the instructions for xref:../expand/index.adoc[expanding a StorageGRID system].
