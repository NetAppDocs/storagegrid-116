[.lead]
You can view local and federated users. You can also create local users and assign them to local admin groups to determine which Grid Manager features these users can access.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

* You have specific access permissions.


== Create a local user

You can create one or more local users and assign each user to one or more local groups. The group's permissions control which Grid Manager and Grid Management API features the user can access.

You can create local users only. Use the external identity source to manage federated users and groups.

The Grid Manager includes one predefined local user, named "`root.`" You cannot remove the root user.

NOTE: If single sign-on (SSO) is enabled, local users cannot sign in to StorageGRID.

=== Access the wizard

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Access control* > *Admin users*.
. Select *Create user*.

=== Enter user credentials
. Enter the user's full name, a unique username, and a password.
. Optionally, select *Yes* if this user should not have access to the Grid Manager or Grid Management API.
. Select *Continue*.

=== Assign to groups

. Optionally, assign the user to one or more groups to determine the user's permissions.
+
If you have not yet created groups, you can save the user without selecting groups. You can add this user to a group on the Groups page. 
+
If a user belongs to multiple groups, the permissions are cumulative. See 
xref:managing-admin-groups.adoc[Manage admin groups] for details.

. Select *Create user* and select *Finish*.


== View and edit local users

You can view details for existing local and federated users. You can modify a local user to change the user's full name, password, or group membership. You can also temporarily prevent a user from accessing the Grid Manager and the Grid Management API.

You can edit local users only. Use the external identity source to manage federated users.

* To view basic information for all local and federated users, review the table on the Users page. 

* To view all details for a specific user, edit a local user, or change a local user's password, use the *Actions* menu or the details page. 
+
Any edits are applied the next time the user signs out and then signs back in to the Grid Manager.
+
NOTE: Local users can change their own passwords using the *Change Password* option in the Grid Manager banner.
