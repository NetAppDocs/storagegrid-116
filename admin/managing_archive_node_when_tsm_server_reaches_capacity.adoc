The TSM server has no way to notify the Archive Node when either the TSM database or the archival media storage managed by the TSM server is nearing capacity. The Archive Node continues to accept object data for transfer to the TSM server after the TSM server stops accepting new content. This content cannot be written to media managed by the TSM server. An alarm is triggered if this happens. This situation can be avoided through proactive monitoring of the TSM server.

.What you'll need

* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.
* You must have specific access permissions.

.About this task

To prevent the ARC service from sending further content to the TSM server, you can take the Archive Node offline by taking its *ARC* > *Store* component offline. This procedure can also be useful in preventing alarms when the TSM server is unavailable for maintenance.

.Steps

. Select *Support* > *Tools* > *Grid Topology*.
. Select *_Archive Node_* > *ARC* > *Store*.
. Select *Configuration* > *Main*.
