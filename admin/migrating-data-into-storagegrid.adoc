You can migrate large amounts of data to the StorageGRID system while simultaneously using the StorageGRID system for day-to-day operations.

The following section is a guide to understanding and planning a migration of large amounts of data into the StorageGRID system. It is not a general guide to data migration, and it does not include detailed steps for performing a migration. Follow the guidelines and instructions in this section to ensure that data is migrated efficiently into the StorageGRID system without interfering with day-to-day operations, and that the migrated data is handled appropriately by the StorageGRID system.
