NFS audit clients are granted access to an audit share based on their IP address. You can remove an existing audit client by removing its IP address.

.What you'll need

* You have the `Passwords.txt` file with the root/admin account password (available in the SAID package).
* You have the `Configuration.txt` file (available in the SAID package).

.About this task

You cannot remove the last IP address permitted to access the audit share.

.Steps

. Log in to the primary Admin Node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_primary_Admin_Node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Start the NFS configuration utility: `config_nfs.rb`
