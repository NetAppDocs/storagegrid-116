. In the S3 and Swift API certificate section, click *Use Default Certificates*.
. Click *OK* in the confirmation dialog box.

When you restore the default server certificates for the object storage API endpoints, the custom server certificate files you configured are deleted and cannot be recovered from the system. The default server certificates are used for all subsequent new API client connections.
