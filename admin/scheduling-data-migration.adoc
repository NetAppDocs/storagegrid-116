Avoid migrating data during core operational hours. Limit data migration to evenings, weekends, and other times when system usage is low.

If possible, do not schedule data migration during periods of high activity. However, if it is not practical to completely avoid the high activity period, it is safe to proceed as long as you closely monitor the relevant attributes and take action if they exceed acceptable values.
