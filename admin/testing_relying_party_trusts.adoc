Before you enforce the use of single sign-on (SSO) for StorageGRID, confirm that single sign-on and single logout (SLO) are correctly configured. If you created a relying party trust for each Admin Node, confirm you can use SSO and SLO for each Admin Node.

.What you'll need

* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.
* You must have specific access permissions.
* You have configured one or more relying party trusts in AD FS.

.Steps

. Select *Configuration* > *Access Control* > *Single Sign-on*.
+
The Single Sign-on page appears, with the *Sandbox Mode* option selected.

. In the instructions for sandbox mode, locate the link to your identity provider's sign-on page.
+
The URL is derived from the value you entered in the *Federated Service Name* field.

 ** If the SSO operation is unsuccessful, an error message appears. Fix the issue, clear the browser's cookies, and try again.
. Repeat the previous steps to confirm you can sign in to any other Admin Nodes.
+
If all SSO sign-in and logout operations are successful, you are ready to enable SSO.
