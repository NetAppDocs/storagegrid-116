Security certificates are small data files used to create secure, trusted connections between StorageGRID components and between StorageGRID components and external systems.

StorageGRID uses two types of security certificates:

* xref:configuring_server_certificates.adoc[*Server certificates*] are required when you use HTTPS connections. Server certificates are used to establish secure connections between clients and servers, authenticating the identity of a server to its clients and providing a secure communication path for data. The server and the client each have a copy of the certificate.
* xref:configuring_administrator_client_certificates.adoc[*Client certificates*] authenticate a client or user identity to the server, providing more secure authentication than passwords alone. Client certificates do not encrypt data.

When a client connects to the server using HTTPS, the server responds with the server certificate, which contains a public key. The client verifies this certificate by comparing the server signature to the signature on its copy of the certificate. If the signatures match, the client starts a session with the server using the same public key.

StorageGRID functions as the server for some connections (such as the load balancer endpoint) or as the client for other connections (such as the CloudMirror replication service).

[#gridca_details]
*Default Grid CA certificate*

StorageGRID also includes a built-in certificate authority (CA) that generates an internal Grid CA certificate during system installation. The Grid CA certificate is used, by default, to secure internal StorageGRID traffic. An external certificate authority (CA) can issue custom certificates that are fully compliant with your organization's information security policies. Although you can use the Grid CA certificate for a non-production environment, the best practice for a production environment is to use custom certificates signed by an external certificate authority. Unsecured connections with no certificate are also supported but are not recommended.

* Custom CA certificates do not remove the internal certificates; however, the custom certificates should be the ones specified for verifying server connections.
* All custom certificates must meet the xref:../harden/index.adoc[system hardening guidelines] for server certificates.
* StorageGRID supports bundling of certificates from a CA into a single file (known as a CA certificate bundle).

NOTE: StorageGRID also includes operating system CA certificates that are the same on all grids. In production environments, make sure that you specify a custom certificate signed by an external certificate authority in place of the operating system CA certificate.

Variants of the server and client certificate types are implemented in several ways. You should have all the certificates needed for your specific StorageGRID configuration ready before you configure the system.

== Access security certificates

You can access information about all StorageGRID certificates in a single location, along with links to the configuration workflow for each certificate.

. From Grid Manger, select *CONFIGURATON* > *Security* > *Certificates*.

* *Global*: secures StorageGRID access from web browsers and external API clients.
* *Grid CA*: secures internal StorageGRID traffic.
* *Client*: secures connections between external clients and the StorageGRID Prometheus database.
* *Load balancer endpoints*: secures connections between S3 and Swift clients and the StorageGRID Load Balancer.
* *Tenants*: secures connections to identity federation servers or from platform service endpoints to S3 storage resources.
* *Other*: secures StorageGRID connections requiring specific certificates.

+
Each tab is described below with links to additional certificate details.

[role="tabbed-block"]
====

.Global
--
The global certificates secure StorageGRID access from web browsers and external API clients. Two global certificates are initially generated by the StorageGRID certificate authority during installation.

* <<Management interface certificate>>: secures client web-browser connections from management interfaces.
* <<S3 and Swift API certificate>>: secures client API connections.

Information about the global certificates that are installed includes:

* *Name*: Certificate name with link to managing the certificate.
* *Description*
* *Type*: Custom or default. +
You should always use a custom certificate for improved grid security.
* *Expiration date*: If using the default Grid CA certificate, no expiration date is shown.

For improved grid security, replace the default certificates with custom certificates signed by an external certificate authority:

* xref:configuring_custom_server_certificate_for_grid_manager_tenant_manager.adoc[Replace the default StorageGRID-generated management interface certificate] used for Grid Manager and Tenant Manager connections.
* xref:configuring_custom_server_certificate_for_storage_node_or_clb.adoc[Replace the S3 and Swift API certificate] used for Storage Node or CLB service (deprecated) connections.

You can restore the default xref:restoring_default_server_certificates_for_grid_manager_tenant_manager.adoc[management interface certificate] and xref:restoring_default_server_certificates_for_s3_swift_api_endpoints.adoc[S3 and Swift API certificate].

You can also xref:generating_self_signed_certificate_for_management_interface.adoc[generate a new self-signed server certificate for the management interface] from within StorageGRID.

--

.Grid CA
--
The <<gridca_details,Grid CA certificate>>, generated by the StorageGRID certificate authority during StorageGRID installation, secures all internal StorageGRID traffic.

Certificate information includes the certificate expiration date and the certificate contents.

You can xref:copying_storagegrid_system_ca_certificate.adoc[copy or download the Grid CA certificate], but cannot change it.

--

.Client
--
<<adminclientcert_details,Client certificates>>, generated by an external certificate authority, secure the connections between external monitoring tools and the StorageGRID Prometheus database.

You can xref:configuring_administrator_client_certificates.adoc[add and remove client certificates] and select if each certificate allows Prometheus database access.

Certificate information includes its Prometheus access permission and the certificate expiration date. Selecting a certificate name displays the certificate details where you can xref:configuring_administrator_client_certificates.adoc[edit, remove, copy, or download the certificate].

*_What does "Actions" do? Enable Prometheus access?_*

--

.Load balancer endpoints
--
<<Load balancer endpoint certificate,Load balancer endpoint certificates>>, that you upload or generate, secure the connections between S3 and Swift clients and the StorageGRID Load Balancer service on Gateway Nodes and Admin Nodes. You can also xref:configuring_load_balancer_endpoints.adoc[use the global S3 and Swift API certificate] instead of generating an new load balancer endpoint certificate.

Certificate information indicates if a load balancer certificate can use the S3 or Swift API and the certificate expiration date. Selecting a certificate name opens a browser tab where you can xref:configuring_load_balancer_endpoints.adoc[view and edit the certificate details].

You can also xref:../fabricpool/creating_load_balancer_endpoint_for_fabricpool.adoc[specify a load balancer endpoint certificate for FabricPool].

--

.Tenants
--
Tenants can use <<Identity federation certificate,identity federation server certificates>> or <<Platform services endpoint certificate,platform service endpoint certificates>> to secure their connections with StorageGRID.

Tenant information indicates which certificate it uses to secure its StorageGRID connections. Selecting a tenant name opens a browser tab where you can view and edit the tenant certificate details for:
* xref:using_identity_federation.adoc[Identity federation certificates] that secures the connection between StorageGRID and the server used for identity federation (groups and users).
* xref:../tenant/editing_platform_services_endpoint.adoc[Platform service endpoint certificates] that secures the connection between a StorageGRID platform service endpoint and an S3 storage resource.

You can also xref:../tenant/tenant/creating_platform_services_endpoint.adoc[specify a platform service endpoint certificate during endpoint creation].

== Certificate examples

=== Example 1: Load Balancer service

In this example, StorageGRID acts as the server.

. You configure a load balancer endpoint and upload or generate a server certificate in StorageGRID.
. You configure an S3 or Swift client connection to the load balancer endpoint and upload the same certificate to the client.
. When the client wants to save or retrieve data, it connects to the load balancer endpoint using HTTPS.
. StorageGRID responds with the server certificate, which contains a public key, and with a signature based on the private key.
. The client verifies this certificate by comparing the server signature to the signature on its copy of the certificate. If the signatures match, the client starts a session using the same public key.
. The client sends object data to StorageGRID.

=== Example 2: External key management server (KMS)

In this example, StorageGRID acts as the client.

. Using external Key Management Server software, you configure StorageGRID as a KMS client and obtain a CA-signed server certificate, a public client certificate, and the private key for the client certificate.
. Using the Grid Manager, you configure a KMS server and upload the server and client certificates and the client private key.
. When a StorageGRID node needs an encryption key, it makes a request to the KMS server that includes data from the certificate and a signature based on the private key.
. The KMS server validates the certificate signature and decides that it can trust StorageGRID.
. The KMS server responds using the validated connection.
