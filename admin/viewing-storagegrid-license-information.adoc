You can view the license information for your StorageGRID system, such as the maximum storage capacity of your grid, whenever necessary.

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

.About this task
If there is an issue with the software license for this StorageGRID system, the Health panel on the Dashboard includes a License Status icon and a *License* link. The number indicates how many license-related issues there are.

.Step
To view the license, do one of the following:

* From the Health panel on the Dashboard, select the License status icon or the *License* link. This link appears only if there is an issue with the license.
* Select *MAINTENANCE* > *System* > *License*.

The License Page appears and provides the following, read-only information about the current license:

 * StorageGRID system ID, which is the unique identification number for this StorageGRID installation
 * License serial number
 * Licensed storage capacity of the grid
 * Software license end date
 * Support service contract end date
 * Contents of the license text file

NOTE: For licenses issued before StorageGRID 10.3, the licensed storage capacity is not included in the license file, and a "See License Agreement" message is displayed instead of a value.
