StorageGRID uses three storage volume watermarks to ensure that Storage Nodes are safely transitioned to a read-only state before before they run critically low on space and to allow Storage Nodes that have been transitioned to a read-only state to become read-write again.

The *Storage Volume Soft Read-Only Watermark* and the *Storage Volume Hard Read-Only Watermark* control when Storage Nodes become read-only, while the *Storage Volume Read-Write Watermark* controls when Storage Nodes can become read-write again.  

The following figure shows the relative position of these three watermarks on a Storage Node. In this example, all of the node's storage volumes are the same size, so they have the same watermark settings.

For any given storage volume, the following statements are always true:

* The Hard Read-Only Watermark is always less than the Soft Read-Only Watermark.

* The Soft Read-Only Watermark is always less than the Read-Write Watermark.

NOTE: The storage volume watermarks only apply to the space used for object data (replicated and erasure-coded copies). To learn about the space reserved for object metadata on volume 0, go to 
xref:managing-object-metadata-storage.adoc[Manage object metadata storage].


== Storage Volume Soft Read-Only Watermark

The Storage Volume Soft Read-Only Watermark is the first watermark to indicate that a Storage Node's usable space for object data is becoming full. If each volume in a Storage Node has less free space than that volume's Soft Read-Only Watermark, the Storage Node automatically transitions into "`soft read-only mode.`" 

Soft read-only mode means that the Storage Node advertises read-only services to the rest of the StorageGRID system, but fulfills all pending write requests.

For example, suppose each volume in a Storage Node has a Soft Read-Only Watermark of 10 GB. If each of these volumes has less than 10 GB of free space, the Storage Node transitions to soft read-only mode.

== Storage Volume Hard Read-Only Watermark

The Storage Volume Hard Read-Only Watermark is the next watermark to indicate that a node's usable space for object data is becoming full. If each volume in a Storage Node has less free space than that volume's Hard Read-Only Watermark, the Storage Node automatically transitions into "`hard read-only mode.`" 

Hard read-only mode means that the Storage Node is read-only and no longer accepts write requests.

For example, suppose each volume in a Storage Node has a Hard Read-Only Watermark of 5 GB. If each of these volume has less than 5 GB of free space, the Storage Node transitions to hard read-only mode.


== Storage Volume Read-Write Watermark

The Storage Volume Read-Write Watermark only applies to Storage Nodes that have transitioned to read-only mode. It determines when the node can become read-write again. When the free space on any one storage volume in a Storage Node is greater than that volumeâ€™s Storage Volume Read-Write Watermark, the node automatically transitions back to the read-write state.

For example, suppose the Storage Node has transitioned to hard read-only mode. Also suppose that each of its volumes has a Read-Write Watermark of 30 GB. If the free space for any one of the volumes increases to 30 GB, the node becomes read-write again.
