StorageGRID uses three storage volume watermarks to ensure that Storage Nodes are safely transitioned to a read-only state before they run critically low on space and to allow Storage Nodes that have been transitioned to a read-only state to become read-write again.

NOTE: Storage volume watermarks only apply to the space used for replicated and erasure-coded object data. To learn about the space reserved for object metadata on volume 0, go to 
xref:managing-object-metadata-storage.adoc[Manage object metadata storage].

== What is the Soft Read-Only Watermark?
The *Storage Volume Soft Read-Only Watermark* is the first watermark to indicate that a Storage Node's usable space for object data is becoming full. 

If each volume in a Storage Node has less free space than that volume's Soft Read-Only Watermark, the Storage Node transitions into _read-only mode_. Read-only mode means that the Storage Node advertises read-only services to the rest of the StorageGRID system, but fulfills all pending write requests.

For example, suppose each volume in a Storage Node has a Soft Read-Only Watermark of 10 GB. As soon as each volume has less than 10 GB of free space, the Storage Node transitions to soft read-only mode.

== What is the Hard Read-Only Watermark?

The *Storage Volume Hard Read-Only Watermark* is the next watermark to indicate that a node's usable space for object data is becoming full. 

If the free space on a volume is less than that volume's Hard Read-Only Watermark, writes to the volume will fail. Writes to other volumes can continue, however, until the free space on those volumes is less than their Hard Read-Only Watermarks.

For example, suppose each volume in a Storage Node has a Hard Read-Only Watermark of 5 GB. As soon as each volume has less than 5 GB of free space, the Storage Node no longer accepts any write requests.

The Hard Read-Only Watermark is always less than the Soft Read-Only Watermark.

== What is the Read-Write Watermark?

The *Storage Volume Read-Write Watermark* only applies to Storage Nodes that have transitioned to read-only mode. It determines when the node can become read-write again. When the free space on any one storage volume in a Storage Node is greater than that volumeâ€™s Read-Write Watermark, the node automatically transitions back to the read-write state.

For example, suppose the Storage Node has transitioned to read-only mode. Also suppose that each volume has a Read-Write Watermark of 30 GB. As soon as the free space for any volume increases to 30 GB, the node becomes read-write again.

The Read-Write Watermark is always larger than both the Soft Read-Only Watermark and the Hard Read-Only Watermark.

== View storage volume watermarks

You can view the current watermark settings and the system-optimized values. If optimized watermarks are not being used, you can determine if you can or should adjust the settings.

.What you'll need

* You have completed the upgrade to StorageGRID 11.6.

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

* You have the Root access permission.

=== View current watermark settings

You can view the current storage watermark settings in the Grid Manager.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Storage options*. 
. In the Storage Watermarks section, look at the settings for the three storage volume watermark overrides.
+
image::../media/storage-volume-watermark-overrides.png[Storage volume watermark overrides]

* If the watermark overrides are *0*, all three watermarks are optimized for every storage volume on every Storage Node, based on the size of the Storage Node and the relative capacity of the volume.  
+
This is the default and recommended setting. You should not update these values. As required, you can optionally <<View optimized storage watermarks>>.

* If the watermark overrides are non-0 values, custom (non-optimized) watermarks are being used. Using custom watermark settings is not recommended. Use the instructions for xref:../monitor/troubleshoot-low-watermark-alert.adoc[troubleshooting Low read-only watermark override alerts] to determine if you can or should adjust the settings.

=== View optimized storage watermarks

StorageGRID uses two Prometheus metrics to show the optimized values it has calculated for the *Storage Volume Soft Read-Only Watermark*. You can view the minimum and maximum optimized values for each Storage Node in your grid.

. Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Metrics*.

. In the Prometheus section, select the link to access the Prometheus user interface.

. To see the recommended minimum soft read-only watermark, enter the following Prometheus metric, and select *Execute*:
+
`storagegrid_storage_volume_minimum_optimized_soft_readonly_watermark`
+
The last column shows the minimum optimized value of the Soft Read-Only Watermark for all storage volumes on each Storage Node. If this value is greater than the custom setting for the *Storage Volume Soft Read-Only Watermark*, the *Low read-only watermark override* alert is triggered for the Storage Node.

. To see the recommended maximum soft read-only watermark, enter the following Prometheus metric, and select *Execute*: 
+
`storagegrid_storage_volume_maximum_optimized_soft_readonly_watermark`
+
The last column shows the maximum optimized value of the Soft Read-Only Watermark for all storage volumes on each Storage Node.
