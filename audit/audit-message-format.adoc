Audit messages exchanged within the StorageGRID system include standard information common to all messages and specific content describing the event or activity being reported.

If the summary information provided by the `audit-explain` and `audit-sum` tools is insufficient, refer to this section to understand the general format of all audit messages.

The following is an example audit message as it might appear in the audit log file:

----
2014-07-17T03:50:47.484627
[AUDT:[RSLT(FC32):VRGN][AVER(UI32):10][ATIM(UI64):1405569047484627][ATYP(FC32):SYSU][ANID(UI32):11627225][AMID(FC32):ARNI][ATID(UI64):9445736326500603516]]
----

Each audit message contains a string of attribute elements. The entire string is enclosed in brackets (`[ ]`), and each attribute element in the string has the following characteristics:

* Enclosed in brackets `[ ]`
* Introduced by the string `AUDT`, which indicates an audit message
* Without delimiters (no commas or spaces) before or after
* Terminated by a line feed character `\n`

Each element includes an attribute code, a data type, and a value that are reported in this format:

----
[ATTR(type):value][ATTR(type):value]...
[ATTR(type):value]\n
----

The number of attribute elements in the message depends on the event type of the message. The attribute elements are not listed in any particular order.

The following list describes the attribute elements:

* `ATTR` is a four-character code for the attribute being reported. There are some attributes that are common to all audit messages and others that are event-specific.
* `type` is a four-character identifier of the programming data type of the value, such as UI64, FC32, and so on. The type is enclosed in parentheses `( )`.
* `value` is the content of the attribute, typically a numeric or text value. Values always follow a colon (`:`). Values of data type CSTR are surrounded by double quotes `" "`.
