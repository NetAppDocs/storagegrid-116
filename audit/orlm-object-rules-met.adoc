|===
The ORLM audit message can be issued a number of times for a single object. For instance, it is issued whenever one of the following events take place:

* ILM rules for the object are satisfied forever.
* ILM rules for the object are satisfied for this epoch.
* ILM rules have deleted the object.
* The background verification process detects that a copy of replicated object data is corrupt. The StorageGRID system performs an ILM evaluation to replace the corrupt object.
