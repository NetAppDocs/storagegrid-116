When a service is stopped gracefully, this message is generated to indicate the shutdown was requested. Typically this message is sent only after a subsequent restart, because the audit message queue is not cleared prior to shutdown. Look for the SYST message, sent at the beginning of the shutdown sequence, if the service has not restarted.

The nature of the shutdown:

SUCS: System was cleanly shutdown.

|===
The message does not indicate if the host server is being stopped, only the reporting service. The RSLT of a SYSD cannot indicate a "dirty" shutdown, because the message is generated only by "clean" shutdowns.
