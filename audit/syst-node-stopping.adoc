When a service is gracefully stopped, this message is generated to indicate the shutdown was requested and that the service has initiated its shutdown sequence. SYST can be used to determine if the shutdown was requested, before the service is restarted (unlike SYSD, which is typically sent after the service restarts.)

Clean Shutdown

The nature of the shutdown:

SUCS: System was cleanly shutdown.

|===
The message does not indicate if the host server is being stopped, only the reporting service. The RSLT code of a SYST message cannot indicate a "dirty" shutdown, because the message is generated only by "clean" shutdowns.
