You can use the `audit-explain` tool to translate the audit messages in the audit log into an easy-to-read format.

.What you'll need

* You must have specific access permissions.
* You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.
* You must know the IP address of the primary Admin Node.

.About this task

The `audit-explain` tool, available on the primary Admin Node, provides simplified summaries of the audit messages in an audit log.

IMPORTANT: The `audit-explain` tool is primarily intended for use by technical support during troubleshooting operations. Processing `audit-explain` queries can consume a large amount of CPU power, which might impact StorageGRID operations.

This example shows typical output from the `audit-explain` tool. These four SPUT audit messages were generated when the S3 tenant with account ID 92484777680322627870 used S3 PUT requests to create a bucket named "bucket1" and add three objects to that bucket.

----
SPUT S3 PUT bucket bucket1 account:92484777680322627870 usec:124673
SPUT S3 PUT object bucket1/part1.txt tenant:92484777680322627870  cbid:9DCB157394F99FE5 usec:101485
SPUT S3 PUT object bucket1/part2.txt tenant:92484777680322627870  cbid:3CFBB07AB3D32CA9 usec:102804
SPUT S3 PUT object bucket1/part3.txt tenant:92484777680322627870  cbid:5373D73831ECC743 usec:93874

The `audit-explain` tool can process plain or compressed audit logs. For example:

----
audit-explain audit.log
----

----
audit-explain 2019-08-12.txt.gz
----

The `audit-explain` tool can also process multiple files at once. For example:

----
audit-explain audit.log 2019-08-12.txt.gz 2019-08-13.txt.gz
----

----
audit-explain /var/local/audit/export/*
----

Finally, the `audit-explain` tool can accept input from a pipe, which allows you to filter and preprocess the input using the `grep` command or other means. For example:

----
grep SPUT audit.log | audit-explain
----

----
grep bucket-name audit.log | audit-explain
----

Since audit logs can be very large and slow to parse, you can save time by filtering parts that you want to look at and running `audit-explain` on the parts, instead of the entire file.

NOTE: The `audit-explain` tool does not accept compressed files as piped input. To process compressed files, provide their file names as command-line arguments, or use the `zcat` tool to decompress the files first. For example:

----
zcat audit.log.gz | audit-explain
----

Use the `help (-h)` option to see the available options. For example:

----
 $ audit-explain -h
----

.Steps

. Log in to the primary Admin Node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_primary_Admin_Node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
. Enter the following command, where `/var/local/audit/export/audit.log` represents the name and the location of the file or files you want to analyze:
+
`$ audit-explain /var/local/audit/export/audit.log`
+
The `audit-explain` tool prints human-readable interpretations of all messages in the specified file or files.
+
NOTE: To reduce line lengths and to aid readability, timestamps are not shown by default. If you want to see the timestamps, use the timestamp (`-t`) option.
