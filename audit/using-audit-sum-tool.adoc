You can use the `audit-sum` tool to count the write, read, head, and delete audit messages and to see the minimum, maximum, and average time (or size) for each operation type.

.What you'll need

* You must have specific access permissions.
* You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.
* You must know the IP address of the primary Admin Node.

.About this task

The `audit-sum` tool, available on the primary Admin Node, summarizes how many write, read, and delete operations were logged and how long these operations took.

IMPORTANT: The `audit-sum` tool is primarily intended for use by technical support during troubleshooting operations. Processing `audit-sum` queries can consume a large amount of CPU power, which might impact StorageGRID operations.

This example shows typical output from the `audit-sum` tool. This example shows how long protocol operations took.

|===
The `audit-sum` tool can process plain or compressed audit logs. For example:

----
audit-sum audit.log
----

----
audit-sum 2019-08-12.txt.gz
----

The `audit-sum` tool can also process multiple files at once. For example:

----
audit-sum audit.log 2019-08-12.txt.gz 2019-08-13.txt.gz
----

----
audit-sum /var/local/audit/export/*
----

Finally, the `audit-sum` tool can also accept input from a pipe, which allows you to filter and preprocess the input using the `grep` command or other means. For example:

----
grep WGET audit.log | audit-sum
----

----
grep bucket1 audit.log | audit-sum
----

----
grep SPUT audit.log | grep bucket1 | audit-sum
----

NOTE: This tool does not accept compressed files as piped input. To process compressed files, provide their file names as command-line arguments, or use the `zcat` tool to decompress the files first. For example:

----
audit-sum audit.log.gz
----

----
zcat audit.log.gz | audit-sum
----

You can use command-line options to summarize operations on buckets separately from operations on objects or to group message summaries by bucket name, by time period, or by target type. By default, the summaries show the minimum, maximum, and average operation time, but you can use the `size (-s)` option to look at object size instead.

Use the `help (-h)` option to see the available options. For example:

----
 $ audit-sum -h
----

.Steps

. Log in to the primary Admin Node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_primary_Admin_Node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
. If you want to analyze all messages related to write, read, head, and delete operations, follow these steps:
 .. Enter the following command, where `/var/local/audit/export/audit.log` represents the name and the location of the file or files you want to analyze:
+
----
$ audit-sum /var/local/audit/export/audit.log

In this example, SGET (S3 GET) operations are the slowest on average at 1.13 seconds, but SGET and SPUT (S3 PUT) operations both show long worst-case times of about 1,770 seconds.

 .. To show the slowest 10 retrieval operations, use the grep command to select only SGET messages and add the long output option (`-l`) to include object paths: `grep SGET audit.log | audit-sum -l`
+
The results include the type (object or bucket) and path, which allows you to grep the audit log for other messages relating to these particular objects.

From this example output, you can see that the three slowest S3 GET requests were for objects about 5 GB in size, which is much larger than the other objects. The large size accounts for the slow worst-case retrieval times.
. If you want to determine what sizes of objects are being ingested into and retrieved from your grid, use the size option (`-s`):

audit-sum -s audit.log

In this example, the average object size for SPUT is under 2.5 MB, but the average size for SGET is much larger. The number of SPUT messages is much higher than the number of SGET messages, indicating that most objects are never retrieved.

. If you want to determine if retrievals were slow yesterday:
 .. Issue the command on the appropriate audit log and use the group-by-time option (`-gt`), followed by the time period (for example, 15M, 1H, 10S):
+
----
 grep SGET audit.log | audit-sum -gt 1H

These results show that S3 GET traffic spiked between 06:00 and 07:00. The max and average times are both considerably higher at these times as well, and they did not ramp up gradually as the count increased. This suggests that capacity was exceeded somewhere, perhaps in the network or in the grid's ability to process requests.

 .. To determine what size objects were being retrieved each hour yesterday, add the size option (`-s`) to the command:
+
----
grep SGET audit.log | audit-sum -gt 1H -s

These results indicate that some very large retrievals occurred when the overall retrieval traffic was at its maximum.

 .. To see more detail, use the `audit-explain` tool to review all the SGET operations during that hour:
+
----
grep 2019-09-05T06 audit.log | grep SGET | audit-explain | less
----
+
If the output of the grep command is expected to be many lines, add the `less` command to show the contents of the audit log file one page (one screen) at a time.
. If you want to determine if SPUT operations on buckets are slower than SPUT operations for objects:
 .. Start by using the `-go` option, which groups messages for object and bucket operations separately:
+
----
grep SPUT sample.log | audit-sum -go
----
+
----
  message group           count     min(sec)        max(sec)    average(sec)

----
+
The results show that SPUT operations for buckets have different performance characteristics than SPUT operations for objects.

 .. To determine which buckets have the slowest SPUT operations, use the `-gb` option, which groups messages by bucket:
+
----
grep SPUT audit.log | audit-sum -gb
----
+
----
  message group                  count     min(sec)        max(sec)    average(sec)
