When existing Storage Nodes become full, you must increase the storage capacity of your StorageGRID system.

To increase storage capacity, you must first understand where data is stored currently and then add capacity in all required locations. For example, if you currently store copies of object data at several sites, you might need to increase the storage capacity of each site.
