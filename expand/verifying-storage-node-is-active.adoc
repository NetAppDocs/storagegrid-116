After an expansion operation that adds new Storage Nodes completes, the StorageGRID system should automatically start using the new Storage Nodes. You must use the StorageGRID system to verify that the new Storage Node is active.

.Steps
. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
. Select *NODES* > *_Expansion Storage Node_* > *Storage*.
. Hover your cursor over the *Storage Used - Object Data* graph to view the value for *Used*, which is the amount of the Total usable space that has been used for object data.
. Verify that the value of *Used* is increasing as you move your cursor to the right on the graph.
