[.lead]
When configuring StorageGRID for use with FabricPool, you can optionally create one or more high availability (HA) groups. An HA group consists of one or more network interfaces on Admin Nodes, Gateway Nodes, or both.

.What you'll need
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Root Access permission.
* If you plan to use a VLAN, you have created the VLAN interface. 

.About this task
Each HA group uses virtual IP addresses (VIPs) to provide highly available access to the shared services on the associated nodes.

For details about this task, see xref:../admin/managing-high-availability-groups.adoc[Manage high availability groups].

.Steps
. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *High Availability Groups*.
. Select one or more of the network interfaces.
. Arrange the interfaces in failover order. The first node in the list is the Primary interface.
+
The Primary interface is the active interface unless a failure occurs that causes the VIP addresses to be reassigned to a Backup interface.

. Enter up to ten IPv4 addresses for the HA group.
