[.lead]
You must create a tenant account in the Grid Manager for FabricPool use.

.What you'll need
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web_browser_requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.

.About this task
Tenant accounts allow client applications to store and retrieve objects on StorageGRID. Each tenant account has its own account ID, authorized groups and users, buckets, and objects.

You can use the same tenant account for multiple ONTAP clusters. Or, you can create a dedicated tenant account for each ONTAP cluster as required.

NOTE: These instructions assume that you have configured single sign-on (SSO) for the Grid Manager. If you are not using SSO, use the instructions for xref:../admin/creating_tenant_account_if_storagegrid_is_not_using_sso.adoc[create a tenant account if StorageGRID is not using SSO].

.Steps
. Select *Tenants*.
. Select *Create*.
. Enter a display name for the FabricPool tenant account.
. Select *S3*.
. Leave the *Allow Platform Services* check box selected to enable the use of platform services.
+
If platform services are enabled, a tenant can use features, such as CloudMirror replication, that access external services.

. Leave the *Storage Quota* field blank.
. In the *Root Access Group* field, select an existing federated group from the Grid Manager to have the initial Root Access permission for the tenant.
. Select *Save*.
