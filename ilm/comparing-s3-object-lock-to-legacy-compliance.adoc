The S3 Object Lock feature in StorageGRID 11.5 replaces the Compliance feature that was available in previous StorageGRID versions. Because the new S3 Object Lock feature conforms to Amazon S3 requirements, it deprecates the proprietary StorageGRID Compliance feature, which is now referred to as "`legacy Compliance.`"

If you previously enabled the global Compliance setting, the new global S3 Object Lock setting is enabled automatically when you upgrade to StorageGRID 11.5. Tenant users will no longer be able to create new buckets with Compliance enabled in StorageGRID 11.5; however, as required, tenant users can continue to use and manage any existing legacy Compliant buckets, which includes performing the following tasks:

* Ingesting new objects into an existing bucket that has legacy Compliance enabled.
* Configuring default retention settings at the bucket level.
* Increasing the retention period of an existing bucket that has legacy Compliance enabled.
* Changing the auto-delete setting for an existing bucket that has legacy Compliance enabled.
* Placing a legal hold on an existing bucket that has legacy Compliance enabled.
* Lifting a legal hold.
