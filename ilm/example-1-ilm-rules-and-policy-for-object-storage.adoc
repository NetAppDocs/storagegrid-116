[.lead]
You can use the following example rules and policy as a starting point when defining an ILM policy to meet your object protection and retention requirements.

CAUTION: The following ILM rules and policy are only examples. There are many ways to configure ILM rules. Before activating a new policy, simulate the proposed policy to confirm it will work as intended to protect content from loss.

== ILM rule 1 for example 1: Copy object data to two data centers

This example ILM rule copies object data to storage pools in two data centers.

Two storage pools, each at different data centers, named Storage Pool DC1 and Storage Pool DC2.

On Day 0, keep two replicated copies forever--one in Storage Pool DC1 and one in Storage Pool DC2.

== ILM rule 2 for example 1: Erasure Coding profile with bucket matching

This example ILM rule uses an Erasure Coding profile and an S3 bucket to determine where and how long the object is stored.

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]

| Rule definition| Example value
a|
Erasure Coding Profile
a|

* One storage pool across three data centers (All 3 sites)
* Use 6+3 erasure-coding scheme

a|
Rule Name
a|
EC for S3 bucket finance-records
a|
Reference Time
a|
Ingest Time
a|
Content Placement
a|
For objects in the S3 bucket named finance-records, create one erasure-coded copy in the pool specified by the Erasure Coding profile. Keep this copy forever.

== ILM policy for example 1

The StorageGRID system allows you to design sophisticated and complex ILM policies; however, in practice, most ILM policies are simple.

A typical ILM policy for a multi-site topology might include ILM rules such as the following:

* At ingest, use 6+3 erasure coding to store all objects belonging to the S3 bucket named `finance-records` across three data centers.
* If an object does not match the first ILM rule, use the policy's default ILM rule, Two Copies Two Data Centers, to store a copy of that object in two data centers, DC1 and DC2.
