You can remove a Cloud Storage Pool that is not used in an ILM rule and that does not contain object data.

.What you'll need
* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.
* You have confirmed that the S3 bucket or Azure container does not contain any objects. An error occurs if you attempt to remove a Cloud Storage Pool if it contains objects. See xref:troubleshooting-cloud-storage-pools.adoc[Troubleshoot Cloud Storage Pools].
+
NOTE: When you create a Cloud Storage Pool, StorageGRID writes a marker file to the bucket or container to identify it as a Cloud Storage Pool. Do not remove this file, which is named `x-ntap-sgws-cloud-pool-uuid`.

* You have already removed any ILM rules that might have used the pool.

.Steps

The Storage Pools page appears.
