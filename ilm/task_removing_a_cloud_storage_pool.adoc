You can remove a Cloud Storage Pool that is not used in an ILM rule and that does not contain object data.

* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.
* You must have specific access permissions.
* You have confirmed that the S3 bucket or Azure container does not contain any objects. An error occurs if you attempt to remove a Cloud Storage Pool if it contains objects. See "`Troubleshooting Cloud Storage Pools.`"
+
NOTE: When you create a Cloud Storage Pool, StorageGRID writes a marker file to the bucket or container to identify it as a Cloud Storage Pool. Do not remove this file, which is named x-ntap-sgws-cloud-pool-uuid.

* You have already removed any ILM rules that might have used the pool.
