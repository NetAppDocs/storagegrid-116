After you have activated an ILM policy, you should ingest representative test objects into the StorageGRID system. You should then perform an object metadata lookup to confirm that copies are being made as intended and placed in the correct locations.

.What you'll need

* You must have an object identifier, which can be one of:
 ** *UUID*: The object's Universally Unique Identifier. Enter the UUID in all uppercase.
 ** *CBID*: The object's unique identifier within StorageGRID. You can obtain an object's CBID from the audit log. Enter the CBID in all uppercase.
 ** *S3 bucket and object key*: When an object is ingested through the S3 interface, the client application uses a bucket and object key combination to store and identify the object.
 ** *Swift container and object name*: When an object is ingested through the Swift interface, the client application uses a container and object name combination to store and identify the object.

.Steps
. Ingest the object.
. Select *ILM* > *Object Metadata Lookup*.
. Type the object's identifier in the *Identifier* field.
+
You can enter a UUID, CBID, S3 bucket/object-key, or Swift container/object-name.

. Click *Look Up*.
+
The object metadata lookup results appear. This page lists the following types of information:
+
 ** System metadata, including the object ID (UUID), the object name, the name of the container, the tenant account name or ID, the logical size of the object, the date and time the object was first created, and the date and time the object was last modified.
 ** Any custom user metadata key-value pairs associated with the object.
 ** For S3 objects, any object tag key-value pairs associated with the object.
 ** For replicated object copies, the current storage location of each copy.
 ** For erasure-coded object copies, the current storage location of each fragment.
 ** For object copies in a Cloud Storage Pool, the location of the object, including the name of the external bucket and the object's unique identifier.
 ** For segmented objects and multipart objects, a list of object segments including segment identifiers and data sizes. For objects with more than 100 segments, only the first 100 segments are shown.
 ** All object metadata in the unprocessed, internal storage format. This raw metadata includes internal system metadata that is not guaranteed to persist from release to release.
+
The following example shows the object metadata lookup results for an S3 test object that is stored as two replicated copies.

. Confirm that the object is stored in the correct location or locations and that it is the correct type of copy.

NOTE: If the Audit option is enabled, you can also monitor the audit log for the ORLM Object Rules Met message. The ORLM audit message can provide you with more information about the status of the ILM evaluation process, but it cannot give you information about the correctness of the object data's placement or the completeness of the ILM policy. You must evaluate this yourself. For details, see the information about understanding audit messages.
