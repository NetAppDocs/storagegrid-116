The table includes the following information for each storage pool that includes Storage Nodes:

 ** *Name*: The unique display name of the storage pool.
 ** *Used Space*: The amount of space that is currently being used to store objects in the storage pool.
 ** *Free Space*: The amount of space that remains available to store objects in the storage pool.
 ** *Total Capacity*: The size of the storage pool, which equals the total amount of usable space for object data for all nodes in the storage pool .
 ** *ILM Usage*: How the storage pool is currently being used. A storage pool might be unused or it might be used in one or more ILM rules, Erasure Coding profiles, or both.
+
NOTE: You cannot remove a storage pool if it is being used.

The table includes the following information for each node:

 ** Node Name
 ** Site Name
 ** Used (%): For Storage Nodes, the percentage of the total usable space for object data that has been used. This value does not include object metadata.
+
NOTE: The same Used (%) value is also shown in the Storage Used - Object Data chart for each Storage Node (select *Nodes* > *_Storage Node_* > *Storage*).

. Select the ILM Usage tab to determine if the storage pool is currently being used in any ILM rules or Erasure Coding profiles.

In this example, the DC1 storage pool is used in three ILM rules: two rules that are in the active ILM policy and one rule that is not in the active policy.

In this example, the All 3 Sites storage pool is used in an Erasure Coding profile. In turn, that Erasure Coding profile is used by one ILM rule in the active ILM policy.
