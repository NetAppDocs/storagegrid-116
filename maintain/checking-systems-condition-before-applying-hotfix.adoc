You must verify the system is ready to accommodate the hotfix.

. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
. If possible, ensure that the system is running normally and that all grid nodes are connected to the grid.
+
Connected nodes have green check marks image:../media/icon_alert_green_checkmark.png[icon alert green checkmark] on the Nodes page.

. Check for and resolve any current alerts, if possible.
+
For information about specific alerts, see the instructions for monitoring and troubleshooting StorageGRID.

. Ensure no other maintenance procedures are in progress, such as an upgrade, recovery, expansion, or decommission procedure.
+
You should wait for any active maintenance procedures to complete before applying a hotfix.
+
You cannot apply a StorageGRID hotfix when another maintenance procedure is running. For example, you cannot apply a hotfix while a decommission, expansion, or recovery procedure is running.
+
NOTE: If a node or site decommission procedure is paused, you can safely apply a hotfix. In addition, you might be able to apply a hotfix during the final stages of a StorageGRID upgrade procedure. See the instructions for upgrading StorageGRID software for details.
