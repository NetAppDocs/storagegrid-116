[.lead]
If you need to remove more than one Storage Node, you can decommission them either sequentially or in parallel.

* If you decommission Storage Nodes sequentially, you must wait for the first Storage Node to complete decommissioning before starting to decommission the next Storage Node.
* If you decommission Storage Nodes in parallel, the Storage Nodes simultaneously process decommission tasks for all Storage Nodes being decommissioned. This can result in a situation where all permanent copies of a file are marked as "`read‐only,`" temporarily disabling deletion in grids where this functionality is enabled.
