Before you can recover StorageGRID grid nodes, you must download the software and extract the files.

You must use the version of StorageGRID that is currently running on the grid.

.Steps

. Determine which version of the software is currently installed. From the top of the Grid Manager, select the help icon and select *About*.
. Go to the NetApp Downloads page for StorageGRID.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/storagegrid/downloads-tab[NetApp Downloads: StorageGRID]

. Select the version of StorageGRID that is currently running on the grid.
+
StorageGRID software versions have this format: 11.x.y.

. Sign in with the username and password for your NetApp account.
. Read the End User License Agreement, select the check box, and then select *Accept & Continue*.
. In the *Install StorageGRID* column of the download page, select the `.tgz` or `.zip` file for your platform.
+
The version shown in the installation archive file must match the version of the software that is currently installed.
+
Use the `.zip` file if you are running Windows.

|OpenStack or other hypervisor
|NetApp-provided virtual machine disk files and scripts for OpenStack are no longer supported for recovery operations. If you need to recover a node running in an OpenStack deployment, download the files for your Linux operating system. Then, follow the procedure for replacing a Linux node.
|===

. Download and extract the archive file.
. Follow the appropriate step for your platform to choose the files you need, based on your platform and which grid nodes you need to recover.
+
The paths listed in the step for each platform are relative to the top-level directory installed by the archive file.

. If you are recovering a VMware system, select the appropriate files.
