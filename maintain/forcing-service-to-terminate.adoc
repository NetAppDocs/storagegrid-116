[.lead]
If you need to stop a service immediately, you can use the `force-stop` command.

.What you'll need

You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.

.Steps

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Manually force the service to terminate: `service _servicename_ force-stop`
+
For example:
+
----
service ldr force-stop
----
+
The system waits 30 seconds before terminating the service.

. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
