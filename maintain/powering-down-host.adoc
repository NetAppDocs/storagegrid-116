Before you power down a host, you must stop services on all grid nodes on that host.

.Steps

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Stop all services running on the node: `service servermanager stop`
+
Services can take up to 15 minutes to shut down, and you might want to log in to the system remotely to monitor the shutdown process.

. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each node on the host.
. If you have a Linux host:
 .. Log in to the host operating system.
 .. Stop the node: `storagegrid node stop`
 .. Shut down the host operating system.
. If the node is running on a VMware virtual machine or it is an appliance node, issue the shutdown command: `shutdown -h now`
+
Perform this step regardless of the outcome of the `service servermanager stop` command.
+
NOTE: After you issue the `shutdown -h now` command on an appliance node, you must power cycle the appliance to restart the node.
+
For the appliance, this command shuts down the controller, but the appliance is still powered on. You must complete the next step.

. If you are powering down an appliance node:
 ** For the SG100 or SG1000 services appliance
  ... Turn off the power to the appliance.
  ... Wait for the blue power LED to turn off.
 ** For the SG6000 appliance
  ... Wait for the green Cache Active LED on the back of the storage controller to turn off.
+
This LED is on when cached data needs to be written to the drives. You must wait for this LED to turn off before you turn off power.

  ... Turn off the power to the appliance, and wait for the blue power LED to turn off.
 ** For the SG5700 appliance
  ... Wait for the green Cache Active LED on the back of the storage controller to turn off.
+
This LED is on when cached data needs to be written to the drives. You must wait for this LED to turn off before you turn off power.

  ... Turn off the power to the appliance, and wait for all LED and seven-segment display activity to stop.
. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
