You might need to shut down your entire StorageGRID system, for example, if you are moving a data center. These steps provide a high-level overview of the recommended sequence for performing a controlled shutdown and startup.

When you power off all nodes in a site or grid, you will not be able to access ingested objects while the Storage Nodes are offline.
