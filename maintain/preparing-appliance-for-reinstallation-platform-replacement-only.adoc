When recovering a grid node that was hosted on a services appliance, you must first prepare the appliance for reinstallation of StorageGRID software.

Perform this procedure only if you are replacing a failed node that was hosted on a services appliance. Do not follow these steps if the failed node was originally hosted on VMware or a Linux host.

. Log in to the failed grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Prepare the appliance for the installation of StorageGRID software. Enter: `sgareinstall`
. When prompted to continue, enter: `y`
+
The appliance reboots, and your SSH session ends. It usually takes about 5 minutes for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to become available, although in some cases you might need to wait up to 30 minutes.
+
The services appliance is reset, and data on the grid node is no longer accessible. IP addresses configured during the original installation process should remain intact; however, it is recommended that you confirm this when the procedure completes.
+
After executing the `sgareinstall` command, all StorageGRID-provisioned accounts, passwords, and SSH keys are removed, and new host keys are generated.
