When recovering an appliance Storage Node, you must first prepare the appliance for reinstallation of StorageGRID software.

. Log in to the failed Storage Node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Prepare the appliance Storage Node for the installation of StorageGRID software. `sgareinstall`
. When prompted to continue, enter: `y`
+
The appliance reboots, and your SSH session ends. It usually takes about 5 minutes for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to become available, although in some cases you might need to wait up to 30 minutes.
+
The StorageGRID appliance Storage Node is reset, and data on the Storage Node is no longer accessible. IP addresses configured during the original installation process should remain intact; however, it is recommended that you confirm this when the procedure completes.
+
After executing the `sgareinstall` command, all StorageGRID-provisioned accounts, passwords, and SSH keys are removed, and new host keys are generated.
