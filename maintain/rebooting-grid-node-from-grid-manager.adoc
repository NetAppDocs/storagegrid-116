NOTE: If you are rebooting the primary Admin Node, the confirmation dialog box reminds you that your browser's connection to the Grid Manager will be lost temporarily when services are stopped.

. Enter the provisioning passphrase, and click *OK*.
. Wait for the node to reboot.
+
It might take some time for services to shut down.
+
When the node is rebooting, the gray icon (Administratively Down) appears on the left side of the Nodes page. When all services have started again, the icon changes back to its original color.
