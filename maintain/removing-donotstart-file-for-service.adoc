When you remove a DoNotStart file that is preventing a service from starting, you must start that service.

.What you'll need

You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.

.Steps

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Remove the DoNotStart file from the service directory: `rm /etc/sv/_service_/DoNotStart`
+
where `service` is the name of the service. For example,
+
----
rm /etc/sv/ldr/DoNotStart

. Start the service: `service _servicename_ start`
. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
