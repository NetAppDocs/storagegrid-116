You can use an SG100 or SG1000 services appliance to recover a failed Gateway Node, a failed non-primary Admin Node, or a failed primary Admin Node that was hosted on VMware, a Linux host, or a services appliance. This procedure is one step of the grid node recovery procedure.

.What you'll need

* You must have determined that one of the following situations is true:
 ** The virtual machine hosting the node cannot be restored.
 ** The physical or virtual Linux host for the grid node has failed, and must be replaced.
 ** The services appliance hosting the grid node must be replaced.
* You must make sure that the StorageGRID Appliance Installer version on the services appliance matches the software version of your StorageGRID system, as described in hardware installation and maintenance for verifying and upgrading the StorageGRID Appliance Installer version.
