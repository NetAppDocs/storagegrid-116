[.lead]
If the system drive has failed, you must first replace the Storage Node.

You must select the node replacement procedure for your platform. The steps to replace a node are the same for all types of grid nodes.

NOTE: This procedure applies to software-based Storage Nodes only. You must follow a different procedure to recover an appliance Storage Node.

*Linux:* If you are not sure if your system drive has failed, follow the instructions to replace the node to determine which recovery steps are required.

|OpenStack
|NetApp-provided virtual machine disk files and scripts for OpenStack are no longer supported for recovery operations. If you need to recover a node running in an OpenStack deployment, download the files for your Linux operating system. Then, follow the procedure for replacing a Linux node.
