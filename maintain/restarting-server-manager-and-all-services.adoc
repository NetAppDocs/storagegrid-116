You might need to restart server manager and all services running on a grid node.

.What you'll need

You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.

.Steps

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Restart Server Manager and all services on the grid node: `service servermanager restart`
+
Server Manager and all services on the grid node are stopped and then restarted.
+
NOTE: Using the `restart` command is the same as using the `stop` command followed by the `start` command.

. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
