You must select Start Recovery in the Grid Manager to configure an appliance Storage Node as a replacement for the failed node.

.What you'll need

* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You must have the Maintenance or Root Access permission.
* You must have the provisioning passphrase.
* You must have deployed a recovery appliance Storage Node.
* You must know the start date of any repair jobs for erasure-coded data.
* You must have verified that the Storage Node has not been rebuilt within the last 15 days.

.Steps

. From the Grid Manager, select *MAINTENANCE* > *Tasks* > *Recovery*.
. Select the grid node you want to recover in the Pending Nodes list.
+
Nodes appear in the list after they fail, but you cannot select a node until it has been reinstalled and is ready for recovery.

. Enter the *Provisioning Passphrase*.
. Click *Start Recovery*.

When the grid node reaches the "`Waiting for Manual Steps`" stage, go to the next topic and perform the manual steps to remount and reformat appliance storage volumes.

NOTE: At any point during the recovery, you can click *Reset* to start a new recovery. An Info dialog box appears, indicating that the node will be left in an indeterminate state if you reset the procedure.

If you want to retry the recovery after resetting the procedure, you must restore the appliance node to a pre-installed state by running `sgareinstall` on the node.
