You might need to start a service that has been stopped, or you might need to stop and restart a service.

.What you'll need

You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.

.Steps

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Decide which command to issue, based on whether the service is currently running or stopped.
 ** If the service is currently stopped, use the `start` command to start the service manually: `service _servicename_ start`
+
For example:
+
----
service ldr start
----

 ** If the service is currently running, use the `restart` command to stop the service and then restart it: `service _servicename_ restart`
+
For example:
+
----
service ldr restart
----
+
NOTE: Using the `restart` command is the same as using the `stop` command followed by the `start` command. You can issue `restart` even if the service is currently stopped.
. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
