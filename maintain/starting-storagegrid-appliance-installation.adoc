[.lead]
To install StorageGRID on an appliance Storage Node, you use the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, which is included on the appliance.

.What you'll need

* The appliance has been installed in a rack, connected to your networks, and powered on.
* Network links and IP addresses have been configured for the appliance using the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
* You know the IP address of the primary Admin Node for the StorageGRID grid.
* All Grid Network subnets listed on the IP Configuration page of the StorageGRID Appliance Installer have been defined in the Grid Network Subnet List on the primary Admin Node.

* You have completed these prerequisite tasks by following the installation and maintenance instructions for your storage appliance:

** xref:../sg5600/index.adoc[SG5600 storage appliances]
** xref:../sg5700/index.adoc[SG5700 storage appliances]
** xref:../sg6000/index.adoc[SG6000 storage appliances]
* You are using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You know one of the IP addresses assigned to the compute controller in the appliance. You can use the IP address for the Admin Network (management port 1 on the controller), the Grid Network, or the Client Network.

.About this task

To install StorageGRID on an appliance Storage Node:

* You specify or confirm the IP address of the primary Admin Node and the name of the node.
* You start the installation and wait as volumes are configured and the software is installed.
* Partway through the process, the installation pauses. To resume the installation, you must sign into the Grid Manager and configure the pending Storage Node as a replacement for the failed node.
* After you have configured the node, the appliance installation process completes, and the appliance is rebooted.

.Steps

. Open a browser and enter one of the IP addresses for the compute controller in the appliance.
+
`+https://Controller_IP:8443+`
+
The StorageGRID Appliance Installer Home page appears.

. In the Primary Admin Node connection section, determine whether you need to specify the IP address for the primary Admin Node.
+
The StorageGRID Appliance Installer can discover this IP address automatically, assuming the primary Admin Node, or at least one other grid node with ADMIN_IP configured, is present on the same subnet.

. If this IP address is not shown or you need to change it, specify the address:

| Option| Steps
|Manual IP entry
|.. Unselect the *Enable Admin Node discovery* check box.
 .. Enter the IP address manually.
 .. Click *Save*.
 .. Wait while the connection state for the new IP address becomes "`ready.`"

|Automatic discovery of all connected primary Admin Nodes
|.. Select the *Enable Admin Node discovery* check box.
 .. From the list of discovered IP addresses, select the primary Admin Node for the grid where this appliance Storage Node will be deployed.
 .. Click *Save*.
 .. Wait while the connection state for the new IP address becomes "`ready.`"

+
|===

. In the *Node Name* field, enter the same name that was used for the node you are recovering, and click *Save*.
. In the Installation section, confirm that the current state is "`Ready to start installation of node name into grid with Primary Admin Node admin_ip`" and that the *Start Installation* button is enabled.
+
If the *Start Installation* button is not enabled, you might need to change the network configuration or port settings. For instructions, see the installation and maintenance instructions for your appliance.

. From the StorageGRID Appliance Installer home page, click *Start Installation*.
