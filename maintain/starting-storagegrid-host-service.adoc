To start your StorageGRID nodes, and ensure they restart after a host reboot, you must enable and start the StorageGRID host service.

. Run the following commands on each host:
+
----
sudo systemctl enable storagegrid
sudo systemctl start storagegrid
----

. Run the following command to ensure the deployment is proceeding:
+
`sudo storagegrid node status _node-name_`
+
For any node that returns a status of Not-Running or Stopped, run the following command:
+
`sudo storagegrid node start _node-name_`

. If you have previously enabled and started the StorageGRID host service (or if you are unsure if the service has been enabled and started), also run the following command:
+
----
sudo systemctl reload-or-restart storagegrid
----
