Some maintenance procedures require you to stop a single service while keeping other services on the grid node running. Only stop individual services when directed to do so by a maintenance procedure.

.What you'll need

You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.

.About this task

When you use these steps to "`administratively stop`" a service, Server Manager will not automatically restart the service. You must either start the single service manually or restart Server Manager.

If you need to stop the LDR service on a Storage Node, be aware that it might take a while to stop the service if there are active connections.

.Steps

. Log in to the grid node:
 .. Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
 .. Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
 .. Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.

+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
. Stop an individual service: `service _servicename_ stop`
+
For example:
+
----
service ldr stop
----
+
NOTE: Services can take up to 11 minutes to stop.

. Log out of the command shell: `exit`
