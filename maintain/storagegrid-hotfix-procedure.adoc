You might need to apply a hotfix to your StorageGRID system if issues with the software are detected and resolved between feature releases.

StorageGRID hotfixes contain software changes that are made available outside of a feature or patch release. The same changes are included in a future release. In addition, each hotfix release contains a roll-up of all previous hotfixes within the feature or patch release.
