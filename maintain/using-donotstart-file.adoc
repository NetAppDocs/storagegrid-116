If you are performing various maintenance or configuration procedures under the direction of technical support, you might be asked to use a DoNotStart file to prevent services from starting when Server Manager is started or restarted.

IMPORTANT: You should add or remove a DoNotStart file only if technical support has directed you to do so.

To prevent a service from starting, place a DoNotStart file in the directory of the service you want to prevent from starting. At start-up, Server Manager looks for the DoNotStart file. If the file is present, the service (and any services dependent on it) is prevented from starting. When the DoNotStart file is removed, the previously stopped service will start on the next start or restart of Server Manager. Services are not automatically started when the DoNotStart file is removed.

The most efficient way to prevent all services from restarting is to prevent the NTP service from starting. All services are dependent on the NTP service and cannot run if the NTP service is not running.
