[.lead]
You can add a network interface to a VM node after the node has been installed. The interfaces you add are displayed on the VLAN interfaces page and the HA groups page.

.What you'll need

* You have access to the instructions for installing StorageGRID on your VMware platform.

xref:../vmware/index.adoc[Install VMware]

* You have configured StorageGRID 11.6
* You have Admin Node and Gateway Node VMware virtual machines
* You have a network subnet that is not being used as Grid, Admin, or Client network
* You have the `Passwords.txt` file.
* You have specific access permissions.

IMPORTANT: Do not attempt to add interfaces to a node while a software upgrade, recovery procedure, or expansion procedure is active.

.About this task

Use these steps to add one or more extra interfaces to a VMware node after the node has been installed. For example, you might want to add an access interface to use in a high availability (HA) group.

If you add an access interface, you can add the interface directly to an HA group; you do not need to configure a VLAN interface. 

The node is unavailable for a brief time when you add interfaces. You should perform this procedure on one node at a time.

.Steps
. In the vCenter, add a new network adapter (type VMXNET3) to an Admin Node and Gateway Node VM.  Select *Connected* and *Connect At Power On* check boxes.

. Use SSH to log in to the Admin Node or Gateway Node. 
. Use `ip l` to confirm the new network interface ens256 is detected.

. Confirm this new interface is ready for use. In Grid Manager, select *CONFIGURATION* > *Network* > *High availability groups*.
. Enter the HA Group name. 
. Select *Continue*. 

. On the *Add interfaces to HA Group* page, confirm `ens256` is shown under the *Interface* column for both the Admin Node and the Gateway Node.  

You can continue to create an HA group using the new interface. Or, if this new interface supports multiple VLANs, you can add the new interface as a VLAN interface for each VLAN it supports before creating the HA Group.
