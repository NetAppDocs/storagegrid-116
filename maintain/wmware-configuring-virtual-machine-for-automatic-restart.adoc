If the virtual machine does not restart after VMware vSphere Hypervisor is restarted, you might need to configure the virtual machine for automatic restart.

You should perform this procedure if you notice that a virtual machine does not restart while you are recovering a grid node or performing another maintenance procedure.

.Steps

. In the VMware vSphere Client tree, select the virtual machine that is not started.
. Right-click the virtual machine, and select *Power on*.
. Configure VMware vSphere Hypervisor to restart the virtual machine automatically in future.
