The file `/var/local/log/bycast.log` is the primary troubleshooting file for the StorageGRID software. There is a `bycast.log` file for every grid node. The file contains messages specific to that grid node.

The file `/var/local/log/bycast-err.log` is a subset of `bycast.log`. It contains messages of severity ERROR and CRITICAL.

Optionally, you can change the destination of audit logs and send audit information to an external syslog server. Local logs of audit records continue to be generated and stored when an external syslog server is configured. See xref:../monitor/configure-audit-messages.adoc[Configure audit messages and log destinations].

== File rotation for bycast.log

When the `bycast.log` file reaches 1 GB, the existing file is saved, and a new log file is started.

The saved file is renamed `bycast.log.1`, and the new file is named `bycast.log`. When the new `bycast.log` reaches 1 GB, `bycast.log.1` is renamed and compressed to become `bycast.log.2.gz`, and `bycast.log` is renamed `bycast.log.1`.

The rotation limit for `bycast.log` is 21 files. When the 22nd version of the `bycast.log` file is created, the oldest file is deleted.

The rotation limit for `bycast-err.log` is seven files.

NOTE: If a log file has been compressed, you must not uncompress it to the same location in which it was written. Uncompressing the file to the same location can interfere with the log rotation scripts.

Optionally, you can change the destination of audit logs and send audit information to an external syslog server. Local logs of audit records continue to be generated and stored when an external syslog server is configured. See xref:../monitor/configure-audit-messages.adoc[Configure audit messages and log destinations].

== Messages in bycast.log

Messages in `bycast.log` are written by the ADE (Asynchronous Distributed Environment). ADE is the runtime environment used by each grid node's services.

Example ADE message:

----

== Message severities in bycast.log

The messages in `bycast.log` are assigned severity levels.

For example:

* *NOTICE* -- An event that should be recorded has occurred. Most log messages are at this level.
* *WARNING* -- An unexpected condition has occurred.
* *ERROR* -- A major error has occurred that will impact operations.
* *CRITICAL* -- An abnormal condition has occurred that has stopped normal operations. You should address the underlying condition immediately. Critical messages are also displayed in the Grid Manager. Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*. Then select *Site* > *Node* > *SSM* > *Events*.

== Error codes in `bycast.log`

Most of the error messages in `bycast.log` contain error codes.
