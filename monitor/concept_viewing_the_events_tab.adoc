The Events tab displays a count of any system error or fault events for a node, including errors such as network errors.

The Events tab is shown for all nodes.

If you experience issues with a particular node, you can use the Events tab to learn more about the issue. Technical support can also use the information on the Events tab to help with troubleshooting.

* Use the information shown for the *Last Event* field at the top of the table to determine which event occurred most recently.
* Click the chart icon image:../media/icon_chart_new.gif[Chart Icon] for a specific event to see when that event occurred over time.
* Reset event counts to zero after resolving any issues.
