[.lead]
Audit messages and logs record system activities and security events and are essential tools for monitoring and troubleshooting. You can adjust audit levels to increase or decrease the type and number of audit messages recorded. Optionally, you can define any HTTP request headers you want to include in client read and write audit messages. You can also configure an external syslog server and change the destination of audit information.

For more information on audit messages, see xref:../audit/audit-message-overview.adoc[Audit message overview].

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have Maintenance or Root access permissions.

.About this task

All StorageGRID nodes generate audit messages and logs to track system activity and events. By default, audit information is sent to the audit log on Admin Nodes. The audit messages recorded in the audit log are filtered based on the settings on the *CONFIGURATION* > *Monitoring* > *Audit and syslog server* page. Adjust audit levels to increase or decrease the type and number of audit messages recorded. Optionally, you can configure audit information to be sent to a remote syslog server. 

== Change audit message levels in the audit log

You can set a different audit level for each of the following categories of messages in the audit log:

[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Audit category| Description
a|
System
a|
By default, this level is set to Normal.
a|
Storage
a|
By default, this level is set to Error.
a|
Management
a|
By default, this level is set to Normal.
a|
Client Reads
a|
By default, this level is set to Normal.
a|
Client Writes
a|
By default, this level is set to Normal.
|===

NOTE: These defaults apply if you initially installed StorageGRID using version 10.3 or later. If you have upgraded from an earlier version of StorageGRID, the default for all categories is set to Normal.

NOTE: During upgrades, audit level configurations will not be effective immediately.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Monitoring* > *Audit and syslog server*.
+
image::../media/audit-messages-main-page.png[Audit messages main page]

. For each category of audit message, select an audit level from the drop-down list:
+
[cols="1a,3a" options="header"]
|===
| Audit level| Description
a|
Off
a|
No audit messages from the category are logged.
a|
Error
a|
Only error messages are logged--audit messages for which the result code was not "successful" (SUCS).
a|
Normal
a|
Standard transactional messages are logged--the messages listed in these instructions for the category.
a|
Debug
a|
Deprecated. This level behaves the same as the Normal audit level.
|===
The messages included for any particular level include those that would be logged at the higher levels. For example, the Normal level includes all of the Error messages.

. Optionally, under *Audit protocol headers*, define any HTTP request headers you want to include in client read and write audit messages. Use an asterisk (\*) as a wildcard to match zero or more characters. Use the escape sequence (\*) to match a literal asterisk. 

+
NOTE: Audit protocol headers apply to S3 and Swift requests only.

. Select *Add another header* to create additional headers, if needed.

+
When HTTP headers are found in a request, they are included in the audit message under the field HTRH.
+
NOTE: Audit protocol request headers are logged only if the audit level for *Client Reads* or *Client Writes* is not *Off*.

. Select *Save*
+
A green banner displays indicating your configuration has been saved successfully.

== Use an external syslog server
By default, audit messages are saved on Admin Nodes and logs are saved on the nodes where they were generated. You can change the default log destinations if needed or you can  configure an external syslog server if you want to save audit messages and logs remotely. 

. If you want to save audit information to an external syslog server, go to xref:../monitor/configuring-syslog-server.adoc[Configure an external syslog server]. After you configure and test the server, proceed to <<Select-audit information-destinations,Select audit information destinations>> to specify which destination to use for audit messages, system events, and application logs.

. If you are not using an external syslog server, proceed to <<Select-audit-information-destinations,Select audit information destinations>>.

[#Select-audit-information-destinations]
== Select audit information destinations
You can specify where security event logs, application logs, and audit message logs are sent. 

NOTE: For more information on StorageGRID software logs, see xref:../monitor/storagegrid-software-logs.adoc#[StorageGRID software logs].

. On the Audit and syslog server page, select the destination for audit information from the listed options: 

+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]

|===
| Option| Description

|Default (Admin nodes/local nodes)
|Audit messages are sent to the audit log on the Admin Node and audit messages are stored on the nodes where they are generated. 

|External syslog server
|Audit messages are sent to an external syslog server and saved on the local node. This option is enabled only after you have configured an external syslog server.

|Admin Node and external syslog server
|Audit messages are sent to the audit log on the Admin Node and the external syslog server, and saved on the local node. This option is enabled only after you have configured an external syslog server.

|Local nodes only
|No audit messages are sent to an Admin Node or remote syslog server. Audit messages and other logs are saved only on the nodes that generated them. 

*Note*: StorageGRID periodically removes these local logs in a rotation to free up space. When the log file reaches 1 GB, the existing file is saved, and a new log file is started. The rotation limit for the log is 21 files. When the 22nd version of the log file is created, the oldest log file is deleted. On average about 20 GB of log data is stored.
|===

NOTE: Audit information generated on every local node is stored in `/var/local/log/localaudit.log`

. Select *Save*.

A warning message appears: 

CAUTION: Change the log destination?

If you selected either *External syslog server* or *Admin Nodes and external syslog server* as the destination for audit information, an additional warning appears:

CAUTION: If you also updated the syslog server configuration, confirm that the external syslog server can receive test StorageGRID messages. If the test messages cannot be delivered and you use this configuration, you might lose important messages regarding StorageGRID events and activities.

[start=3]
. Confirm that you want to change the destination for audit information by selecting *OK*.


+
A green banner appears notifying you that your audit configuration has been saved successfully. 

+
New logs are sent to the destinations you selected. Existing logs remain in their current location.
