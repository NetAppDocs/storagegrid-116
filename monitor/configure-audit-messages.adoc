[.lead]
All StorageGRID nodes generate audit messages and logs to track system activity and events. You can adjust audit levels to increase or decrease the number of audit messages recorded in the audit log for each audit message category. You can also configure and external syslog server and change the destination of audit information.


.What you'll need

* You must are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have Maintenance or Root Access permissions.

.About this task

By default, audit messages are sent to the audit log on Admin Nodes. The audit messages recorded in the audit log are filtered based on the settings on the *CONFIGURATION* > *Monitoring* > *Audit and syslog server* page. Optionally, you can configure audit messages to be sent to a remote syslog server. 

== Change audit message levels in the audit log

You can set a different audit level for each of the following categories of messages in the audit log:

* *System*: By default, this level is set to Normal.
* *Storage*: By default, this level is set to Error.
* *Management*: By default, this level is set to Normal.
* *Client Reads*: By default, this level is set to Normal.
* *Client Writes*: By default, this level is set to Normal.

NOTE: These defaults apply if you initially installed StorageGRID using version 10.3 or later. If you have upgraded from an earlier version of StorageGRID, the default for all categories is set to Normal.

NOTE: During upgrades, audit level configurations will not be effective immediately.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Monitoring* > *Audit messages and logs*.

//need new screen

. For each category of audit message, select an audit level from the drop-down list:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="20,80"]
[options="header"]
|===
| Audit level| Description
a|
Off
a|
No audit messages from the category are logged.
a|
Error
a|
Only error messages are logged--audit messages for which the result code was not "successful" (SUCS).
a|
Normal
a|
Standard transactional messages are logged--the messages listed in these instructions for the category.
a|
Debug
a|
Deprecated. This level behaves the same as the Normal audit level.
|===
The messages included for any particular level include those that would be logged at the higher levels. For example, the Normal level includes all of the Error messages.

. Under *Audit protocol headers*, enter the name of the HTTP request headers to be included in Client Reads and Client Writes audit messages. Use an asterisk (\*) as a wildcard, or use the escape sequence (\*) as a literal asterisk. Select *Add another header* to create additional headers.
//Optional? how many headers can be added? why use headers? Such? 
+
NOTE: Audit protocol headers apply to S3 and Swift requests only.
+
When such HTTP headers are found in a request, they are included in the audit message under the field HTRH.
+
NOTE: Audit protocol request headers are logged only if the audit level for *Client Reads* or *Client Writes* is not *Off*.

. Click *Save*

== Edit the syslog server
By default, audit messages are saved on Admin Nodes and logs are saved on the nodes where they were generated. If you want to save audit messages and a subset of logs externally, configure an external syslog server. 

To configure an external syslog server, see xref:../monitor/configuring-syslog-server.adoc[Configure an external syslog server] to open the syslog server configuration wizard. 

NOTE: The remote syslog server must have the capacity to receive and store the log files. 

== [[Change-audit-destinations]]Change audit information destinations

You can specify whether security event logs, application logs, and audit messages are sent to Admin Nodes (default), to an external syslog server, or both. 

. [[Select-the-destination-for-audit-messages-from-the-listed-options]]Select the destination for audit messages from the listed options.

|===
| Option| Description

|Admin Node
|Audit messages are sent to the audit log on the Admin Node.

|External syslog server
|Audit messages are sent to an external syslog server and saved on the local node. This option is enabled only after you have configured the external syslog server.

|Admin Node and external syslog server.
|Audit messages are sent to the audit log on the Admin Node and the external syslog server, and saved on the local node. 

|None
|No audit messages are sent to an Admin Node or remote syslog server. Audit messages are still logged on the local node.
