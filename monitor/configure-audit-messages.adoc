[.lead]
Audit messages and logs record system activities and security events and are an essential tool for monitoring and troubleshooting. Adjust audit levels to increase or decrease the type and number of audit messages recorded. Optionally, define any HTTP request headers you want to include in client read and write audit messages. You can also configure an external syslog server and change the destination of audit information.

For more information on audit messages, see xref:../audit/audit-message-overview.adoc[Audit message overview].

.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have Maintenance or Root Access permissions.

.About this task

All StorageGRID nodes generate audit messages and logs to track system activity and events. By default, audit messages are sent to the audit log on Admin Nodes. The audit messages recorded in the audit log are filtered based on the settings on the *CONFIGURATION* > *Monitoring* > *Audit and syslog server* page. Optionally, you can configure audit messages to be sent to a remote syslog server. 

== Change audit message levels in the audit log

You can set a different audit level for each of the following categories of messages in the audit log:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="20,80"]
[options="header"]
|===
| Audit category| Description
a|
System
a|
By default, this level is set to Normal.
a|
Storage
a|
By default, this level is set to Error.
a|
Management
a|
By default, this level is set to Normal.
a|
Client Reads
a|
By default, this level is set to Normal.
a|
Client Writes
a|
By default, this level is set to Normal.
|===

//add detail

NOTE: These defaults apply if you initially installed StorageGRID using version 10.3 or later. If you have upgraded from an earlier version of StorageGRID, the default for all categories is set to Normal.

NOTE: During upgrades, audit level configurations will not be effective immediately.

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Monitoring* > *Audit and syslog server*.
+
image::../media/audit-messages-main-page.png[Audit messages main page]
//need new screen

. For each category of audit message, select an audit level from the drop-down list:
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="20,80"]
[options="header"]
|===
| Audit level| Description
a|
Off
a|
No audit messages from the category are logged.
a|
Error
a|
Only error messages are logged--audit messages for which the result code was not "successful" (SUCS).
a|
Normal
a|
Standard transactional messages are logged--the messages listed in these instructions for the category.
a|
Debug
a|
Deprecated. This level behaves the same as the Normal audit level.
|===
The messages included for any particular level include those that would be logged at the higher levels. For example, the Normal level includes all of the Error messages.

. Under *Audit protocol headers*, enter the name of the HTTP request headers to be included in Client Reads and Client Writes audit messages. Use an asterisk (\*) as a wildcard, or use the escape sequence (\*) as a literal asterisk. Select *Add another header* to create additional headers.
//Optional? how many headers can be added? why use headers? Such? 
+
NOTE: Audit protocol headers apply to S3 and Swift requests only.
+
When such HTTP headers are found in a request, they are included in the audit message under the field HTRH.
+
NOTE: Audit protocol request headers are logged only if the audit level for *Client Reads* or *Client Writes* is not *Off*.

. Click *Save*

== Use external syslog server
//add table info
By default, audit messages are saved on Admin Nodes and logs are saved on the nodes where they were generated. 

. If you want the default behavior, select *Default (Admin Nodes/local nodes)*.

. If you want to save audit messages and a subset of logs externally, you must first configure an external syslog server. 

+
See xref:../monitor/configuring-syslog-server.adoc[Configure an external syslog server] to open the syslog server configuration wizard. 

== [[Select-the-destination-for-audit-information]]Select audit information destinations
You can specify where security event logs, application logs, and audit message logs are sent. 

. Select the destination for audit information from the listed options: 

+
[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]

|===
| Option| Description

|Default (Admin nodes/local nodes)
|Audit messages are sent to the audit log on the Admin Node and audit messages are stored on the nodes where they are generated. 

|External syslog server
|Audit messages are sent to an external syslog server and saved on the local node. This option is enabled only after you have configured an external syslog server.
//are these enabled even when a syslog server is not configured? 

|Admin Node and external syslog server
|Audit messages are sent to the audit log on the Admin Node and the external syslog server, and saved on the local node. This option is enabled only after you have configured an external syslog server.

|Local nodes only
|No audit messages are sent to an Admin Node or remote syslog server. Audit messages and other logs are saved only on the nodes that generated them. StorageGRID periodically removes these logs to free up space.

|===
NOTE: Audit information generated on every local node is stored in `/var/local/log/localaudit.log`

. Click *Save*. 

A green banner appears notifying you that your audit configuration has been saved successfully.
