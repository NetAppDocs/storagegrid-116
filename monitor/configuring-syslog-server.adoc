 If you want to save audit messages and a subset of logs to a location outside of your grid, use this procedure to configure an external syslog server. 


.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have Maintenance or Root Access permissions.
* You have a syslog server with the capacity to receive and store the log files. 
//need specs

.About this task

By default, audit messages are saved on Admin Nodes and logs are saved on the nodes where they were generated. If you want to send audit information to an external syslog server, use this procedure to configure it. Local logs of audit records continue to be generated and stored when an external syslog server is configured

Sending audit information to an external syslog server enables you to:

* Collect and manage audit information such as audit messages, application logs, and authentication events more efficiently
* Reduce network traffic on your admin nodes

NOTE: When using an external syslog server, single logs greater than 8K are truncated at the end of the message.

=== Send test messages
Use this page to send test messages to the newly configured remote syslog server to determine if the server is configured correctly.
