[.lead]
 If you want to save audit messages and a subset of logs to a location outside of your grid, use this procedure to configure an external syslog server. 


.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have Maintenance or Root Access permissions.
* You have a syslog server with the capacity to receive and store the log files. 
//need specs

.About this task

By default, audit messages are saved on Admin Nodes and logs are saved on the nodes where they were generated. If you want to send audit information to an external syslog server, use this procedure to configure it. Local logs of audit records continue to be generated and stored when an external syslog server is configured.

Any of these types of logs can be sent to the external syslog server:
•	Audit logs containing the audit messages generated during normal system operation
•	Security events that might compromise your StorageGRID system
•	Application logs that are frequently needed for troubleshooting

Sending audit information to an external syslog server enables you to:

* Collect and manage audit information such as audit messages, application logs, and authentication events more efficiently
* Reduce network traffic on your admin nodes

NOTE: When using an external syslog server, single logs greater than 8K are truncated at the end of the message. 

.Steps

. Select *CONFIGURATION* > *Monitoring* > *Audit and syslog server*.

//need update all screens

== [[Access-the-syslog-server-configuration-wizard]]Access the syslog server configuration wizard
. From the Audit messages and logs page, Select *Configure external syslog server*.

=== Enter syslog server address information
The Configure external syslog server page appears: 
//banner always there?

image::../media/enter-syslog-info.png[Enter syslog info]

. Enter the FQDN or IP of the remote server in the Host field.
. Enter the port of the remote server.
. Select the protocol used to send the audit information to the remote server: 
* *TCP*
* *TLS*
* *RELP/TCP*
* *RELP/TLS*
* *UDP*
//
+
.. If you select UDP or TCP, select *Continue*.
.. If you select TLS or RELP/TLS, you must attach at least one certificate. 
[#attach-certificate]

Using a certificate secures the connections between your grid and the external syslog server. If you select TLS or RELP/TLS as the protocol for your audit information, the following options appear:

* *Server CA certificates*: The certificate file in PEM encoding.
//get description
* *Client certificate*: The certificate file in PEM encoding.
* *Client private key*: The custom server certificate private key file (`.key`).
//other extensions?

+
NOTE: EC private keys must be 224 bits or larger. RSA private keys must be 2048 bits or larger.
// private key restriction true?
//can you upload more then one CA certificate? why? 

.. Select *Browse* for the certificate or key you want to use. 
+
NOTE: If you use a client certificate you must also use a client private key. 

.. Select the certificate file or key file.
.. select *Open* to upload the file.
.. Select *Continue*
.. 
//in what situations would you use one or the other? 
//of the remote server? Select Browse to upload the new certificate.

//can this be used for syslog? 
 ** *CA bundle*: A single optional file containing the certificates from each intermediate issuing certificate authority (CA). The file should contain each of the PEM-encoded CA certificate files, concatenated in certificate chain order.

=== Manage Syslog content
//. Select **.
//can you configure an external syslog server and not use it? 

. Select the type of audit information you want to send to the external syslog server. You can send any combination of the following: 

+
*Audit logs*: StorageGRID events and system activities

+
*Security events*: Security events such as when an unauthorized user attempts to sign in or a user signs in as root

+
*Application logs*: Log files useful for troubleshooting

. Use the dropdowns to select the severity and facility for the type of information you want to send.

//add tables and finish

Severity

Select Passthrough if you want each message sent to the external syslog to have the same severity value as it does in the local syslog. 

Otherwise, enter the severity value you want to use for all severity event messages sent to the external syslog. You can enter any value between 0 and 7.

•	0 - Emergency: System is unusable
•	1 - Alert: Action must be taken immediately
•	2 - Critical: Critical conditions
•	3 - Error: Error conditions
•	4 - Warning: Warning conditions
•	5 - Notice: Normal but significant condition
•	6 - Informational: Informational messages
•	7 - Debug: Debug-level messages

. Select *Continue*.

=== Send test messages
To verify that the external syslog server is configured correctly, you can request that all nodes send a test message to the syslog server. 

IMPORTANT: Do not use the syslog server configuration until you confirm that the syslog server received a test message from each node in your grid.


 . Select *Send test messages*
 
 +
 Test results continuously appear on the page until you stop the test. While the test is in progress, your audit messages continue to be sent to your previously configured destinations.

 . If you received any errors, correct them and select *send test messages* again. 

. Click *Finish* when all nodes have passed testing. 
A green banner will appear notifiying you that your syslog server configuration has been saved.
