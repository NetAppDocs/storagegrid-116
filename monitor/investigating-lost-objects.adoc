[.lead]
When the *Objects lost* alert is triggered, you must investigate immediately. Collect information about the affected objects and contact technical support.

.What you'll need
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You must have specific access permissions.
* You must have the `Passwords.txt` file.

.About this task
The *Objects lost* alert indicates that StorageGRID believes that there are no copies of an object in the grid. Data might have been permanently lost.

Investigate lost object alerts immediately. You might need to take action to prevent further data loss. In some cases, you might be able to restore a lost object if you take prompt action.

.Steps
. Select *NODES*.
. Select *_Storage Node_* > *Objects*.
. Review the number of Lost objects shown in the Object counts table.
+
This number indicates the total number of objects this grid node detects as missing from the entire StorageGRID system. The value is the sum of the Lost objects counters of the Data store component within the LDR and DDS services.

. From an Admin Node, access the audit log to determine the unique identifier (UUID) of the object that triggered the *Objects lost* alert:
 .. Log in to the grid node:
  ... Enter the following command: `ssh admin@grid_node_IP`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
  ... Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
 .. Change to the directory where the audit logs are located. Enter: `cd /var/local/audit/export/`
 .. Use grep to extract the Object Lost (OLST) audit messages. Enter: `grep OLST audit_file_name`
 .. Note the UUID value included in the message.

. Use the `ObjectByUUID` command to find the object by its identifier (UUID), and then determine if data is at risk.
 .. Telnet to localhost 1402 to access the LDR console.
 .. Enter: `/proc/OBRP/ObjectByUUID UUID_value`

In this first example, the object with `UUID 926026C4-00A4-449B-AC72-BCCA72DD1311` has two locations listed.

| Metadata| Conclusion

|No object found ("ERROR":"" )
|If the object is not found, the message "ERROR":"" is returned.

If the object is not found, you can reset the count of *Objects lost* to clear the alert. The lack of an object indicates that the object was intentionally deleted.

|Locations > 0
|If there are locations listed in the output, the *Objects lost* alert might be a false positive.

Confirm that the objects exist. Use the Node ID and filepath listed in the output to confirm that the object file is in the listed location.

(The procedure for xref:searching-for-and-restoring-potentially-lost-objects.adoc[searching for potentially lost objects] explains how to use the Node ID to find the correct Storage Node.)



If the objects exist, you can reset the count of *Objects lost* to clear the alert.


|Locations = 0
|If there are no locations listed in the output, the object is potentially missing. You can try to xref:searching-for-and-restoring-potentially-lost-objects.adoc[search for and restore the object] yourself, or you can contact technical support.



Technical support might ask you to determine if there is a storage recovery procedure in progress. That is, has a _repair-data_ command been issued on any Storage Node, and is the recovery still in progress? See the information about xref:../maintain/restoring-object-data-to-storage-volume-if-required.adoc[restoring object data to a storage volume].
