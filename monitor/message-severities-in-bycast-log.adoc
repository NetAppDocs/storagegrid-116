[.lead]
The messages in `bycast.log` are assigned severity levels.

For example:

* *NOTICE* -- An event that should be recorded has occurred. Most log messages are at this level.
* *WARNING* -- An unexpected condition has occurred.
* *ERROR* -- A major error has occurred that will impact operations.
* *CRITICAL* -- An abnormal condition has occurred that has stopped normal operations. You should address the underlying condition immediately. Critical messages are also displayed in the Grid Manager. Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*. Then select *Site* > *Node* > *SSM* > *Events*.
