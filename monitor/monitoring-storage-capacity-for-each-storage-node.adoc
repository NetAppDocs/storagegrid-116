[.lead]
You must monitor the total usable space for each Storage Node to ensure that the node has enough space for new object data.

.What you'll need
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

.About this task
Usable space is the amount of storage space available to store objects. The total usable space for a Storage Node is calculated by adding together the available space on all object stores within the node.

.Steps
. Select *NODES* > *_Storage Node_* > *Storage*.
+
The graphs and tables for the node appear.

. Hover your cursor over the Storage used - object data graph.
+
The following values are shown:

 ** *Used (%)*: The percentage of the Total usable space that has been used for object data.
 ** *Used*: The amount of the Total usable space that has been used for object data.
 ** *Replicated data*: An estimate of the amount of replicated object data on this node, site, or grid.
 ** *Erasure-coded data*: An estimate of the amount of erasure-coded object data on this node, site, or grid.
 ** *Total*: The total amount of usable space on this node, site, or grid.
The Used value is the `storagegrid_storage_utilization_data_bytes` metric.

. Review the Available values in the Volumes and Object stores tables, below the graphs.

NOTE: To view graphs of these values, click the chart icons image:../media/icon_chart_new_for_11_5.png[Chart Icon] in the Available columns.

. Monitor the values over time to estimate the rate at which usable storage space is being consumed.
. To maintain normal system operations, add Storage Nodes, add storage volumes, or archive object data before usable space is consumed.
+
When planning the timing of an expansion, consider how long it will take to procure and install additional storage.
+
NOTE: If your ILM policy uses erasure coding, you might prefer to expand when existing Storage Nodes are approximately 70% full to reduce the number of nodes that must be added.
+
For more information on planning a storage expansion, see the instructions for expanding StorageGRID.
+
The *Low object data storage* alert is triggered when insufficient space remains for storing object data on a Storage Node.
