You should monitor the overall health of your StorageGRID system on a daily basis.

.About this task
The StorageGRID system is fault tolerant and can continue to operate even when parts of the grid are unavailable. The first sign of a potential issue with your StorageGRID system is likely to be an alert or an alarm (legacy system) and not necessarily an issue with system operations. Paying attention to system health can help you detect minor issues before they affect operations or grid efficiency.

The Health panel on the Grid Manager Dashboard provides a summary of issues that might be affecting your system. You should investigate any issues that are shown on the Dashboard.

NOTE: To be notified of alerts as soon as they are triggered, you can set up email notifications for alerts or configure SNMP traps.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Grid Manager to view the Dashboard.
. Review the information in the Health panel.
