The underlying storage on a Storage Node is divided into object stores. Object stores are also known as storage volumes.

You can view object store information for each Storage Node. Object stores are shown at the bottom of the *NODES* > *_Storage Node_* > *Storage* page.

To see more details about each Storage Node, follow these steps:

. Select *SUPPORT* > *Tools* > *Grid topology*.
. Select *_site_* > *_Storage Node_* > *LDR* > *Storage* > *Overview* > *Main*.

Depending on the nature of the failure, faults with a storage volume might be reflected in an alarm on the storage status or on the health of an object store. If a storage volume fails, you should repair the failed storage volume to restore the Storage Node to full functionality as soon as possible. If necessary, you can go to the *Configuration* tab and place the Storage Node in a read‚Äêonly state so that the StorageGRID system can use it for data retrieval while you prepare for a full recovery of the server.
