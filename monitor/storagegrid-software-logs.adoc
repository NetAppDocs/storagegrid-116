You can use StorageGRID logs to troubleshoot issues. 

NOTE: If you want to send your logs to an external syslog server or change the destination of audit information such as the `bycast.log` and `nms.log`, see xref:../monitor/configure-audit-messages.adoc#[Configure audit messages and log destinations].
