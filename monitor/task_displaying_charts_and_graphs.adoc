The Nodes page contains the graphs and charts you should access regularly to monitor attributes such as storage capacity and throughput. In some cases, especially when working with technical support, you can use the *Support* > *Tools* > *Grid Topology* page to access additional charts.

You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a supported browser.

. Select *Nodes*. Then, select a node, a site, or the entire grid.
. Select the tab for which you want to view information.

Some tabs include one or more Grafana charts, which are used to plot the values of Prometheus metrics over time. For example, the *Nodes* > *Hardware* tab for a node includes two Grafana charts.
