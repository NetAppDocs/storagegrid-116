If you encounter a problem when using a StorageGRID system, refer to the tips and guidelines in this section for help in determining and resolving the issue.

== Overview of problem determination

[.lead]
If you encounter a problem when administering a StorageGRID system, you can use the process outlined in this figure to identify and analyze the issue. In many cases, you can resolve problems on your own; however, you might need to escalate some issues to technical support.

=== Defining the problem

The first step to solving a problem is to define the problem clearly.

This table provides examples of the types of information that you might collect to define a problem:

[cols="1a,1a" options="header"]
|===
| Question| Sample response

|What is the StorageGRID system doing or not doing? What are its symptoms?
|Client applications are reporting that objects cannot be ingested into StorageGRID.

|When did the problem start?
|Object ingest was first denied at about 14:50 on January 8, 2020.

|How did you first notice the problem?
|Notified by client application. Also received alert email notifications.

|Does the problem happen consistently, or only sometimes?
|Problem is ongoing.

|If the problem happens regularly, what steps cause it to occur
|Problem happens every time a client tries to ingest an object.

|If the problem happens intermittently, when does it occur? Record the times of each incident that you are aware of.
|Problem is not intermittent.

|Have you seen this problem before? How often have you had this problem in the past?
|This is the first time I have seen this issue.
|===

=== Assessing the risk and impact on the system

After you have defined the problem, assess its risk and impact on the StorageGRID system. For example, the presence of critical alerts does not necessarily mean that the system is not delivering core services.

This table summarizes the impact the example problem is having on system operations:

[cols="1a,1a" options="header"]
|===
| Question| Sample response

|Can the StorageGRID system ingest content?
|No.

|Can client applications retrieve content?
|Some objects can be retrieved and others cannot.

|Is data at risk?
|No.

|Is the ability to conduct business severely affected?
|Yes, because client applications cannot store objects to the StorageGRID system and data cannot be retrieved consistently.
|===

=== Collecting data

After you have defined the problem and have assessed its risk and impact, collect data for analysis. The type of data that is most useful to collect depends upon the nature of the problem.

[cols="1a,2a,1a" options="header"]
|===
| Type of data to collect| Why collect this dat| Instructions
|
Create timeline of recent changes
|
Changes to your StorageGRID system, its configuration, or its environment can cause new behavior.
|

|
Review alerts and alarms
|
Alerts and alarms can help you quickly determine the root cause of a problem by providing important clues as to the underlying issues that might be causing it.

Review the list of current alerts and alarms to see if StorageGRID has identified the root cause of a problem for you.

Review alerts and alarms triggered in the past for additional insights.

==== Creating a timeline of recent changes

When a problem occurs, you should consider what has changed recently and when those changes occurred.

* Changes to your StorageGRID system, its configuration, or its environment can cause new behavior.
* A timeline of changes can help you identify which changes might be responsible for an issue, and how each change might have affected its development.

Create a table of recent changes to your system that includes information about when each change occurred and any relevant details about the change, such information about what else was happening while the change was in progress:

[cols="1a,1a,1a" options="header"]
|===
| Time of change| Type of change| Details
|
For example:

* When did you start the node recovery?
* When did the software upgrade complete?
* Did you interrupt the process?

|
What happened? What did you do?

|
Document any relevant details about the change. For example:

* Details of the network changes.
* Which hotfix was installed.
* How client workloads changed.

Make sure to note if more than one change was happening at the same time. For example, was this change made while an upgrade was in progress?

xref:troubleshooting-storagegrid-system.adoc[RECENT_CHANGES]

|===

===== Examples of significant recent changes

Here are some examples of potentially significant changes:

* Was the StorageGRID system recently installed, expanded, or recovered?
* Has the system been upgraded recently? Was a hotfix applied?
* Has any hardware been repaired or changed recently?
* Has the ILM policy been updated?
* Has the client workload changed?
* Has the client application or its behavior changed?
* Have you changed load balancers, or added or removed a high availability group of Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes?
* Have any tasks been started that might take a long time to complete? Examples include:
 ** Recovery of a failed Storage Node
 ** Storage Node decommissioning
* Have any changes been made to user authentication, such as adding a tenant or changing LDAP configuration?
* Is data migration taking place?
* Were platform services recently enabled or changed?
* Was compliance enabled recently?
* Have Cloud Storage Pools been added or removed?
* Have any changes been made to storage compression or encryption?
* Have there been any changes to the network infrastructure? For example, VLANs, routers, or DNS.
* Have any changes been made to NTP sources?
* Have any changes been made to the Grid, Admin, or Client Network interfaces?
* Have any configuration changes been made to the Archive Node?
* Have any other changes been made to the StorageGRID system or its environment?

==== Establishing baselines

You can establish baselines for your system by recording the normal levels of various operational values. In the future, you can compare current values to these baselines to help detect and resolve abnormal values.

=== Analyzing data

Use the information that you collect to determine the cause of the problem and potential solutions.

The analysis is problem‐dependent, but in general:

* Locate points of failure and bottlenecks using the alarms.
* Reconstruct the problem history using the alarm history and charts.
* Use charts to find anomalies and compare the problem situation with normal operation.

=== Escalation information checklist

If you cannot resolve the problem on your own, contact technical support. Before contacting technical support, gather the information listed in the following table to facilitate problem resolution.
