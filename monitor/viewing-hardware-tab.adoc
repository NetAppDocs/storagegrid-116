If the node is an appliance node, this tab also includes a section with more information about the appliance hardware.

== View information about appliance Storage Nodes

The Nodes page lists information about service health and all computational, disk device, and network resources for each appliance Storage Node. You can also see memory, storage hardware, controller firmware version, network resources, network interfaces, network addresses, and receive and transmit data.

.Steps
. From the Nodes page, select an appliance Storage Node.
. Select *Overview*.
+
The Node information section of the Overview tab displays summary information for the node, such as the node's name, type, ID, and connection state. The list of IP addresses includes the name of the interface for each address, as follows:

 ** *eth*: The Grid Network, Admin Network, or Client Network.
 ** *hic*: One of the physical 10, 25, or 100 GbE ports on the appliance. These ports can be bonded together and connected to the StorageGRID Grid Network (eth0) and Client Network (eth2).
 ** *mtc*: One of the physical 1 GbE ports on the appliance.  One or more mtc interfaces are bonded to form the StorageGRID Admin Network interface (eth1). You can leave other mtc interfaces available for temporary local connectivity for a technician in the data center.
