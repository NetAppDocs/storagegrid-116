The Nodes page lists information about service health and all computational, disk device, and network resources for each services appliance that is used for an Admin Node or a Gateway Node. You can also see memory, storage hardware, network resources, network interfaces, network addresses, and receive and transmit data.

.Steps
. From the Nodes page, select an appliance Admin Node or an appliance Gateway Node.
. Select *Overview*.
+
The Node Information table on the Overview tab displays the node's ID and name, the node type, the software version installed, and the IP addresses associated with the node. The Interface column contains the name of the interface, as follows:

 ** *adllb* and *adlli*: Shown if active/backup bonding is used for the Admin Network interface
 ** *eth*: The Grid Network, Admin Network, or Client Network.
 ** *hic*: One of the physical 10, 25, or 100 GbE ports on the appliance. These ports can be bonded together and connected to the StorageGRID Grid Network (eth0) and Client Network (eth2).
 ** *mtc*: One of the physical 1 GbE ports on the appliance, which can be bonded or aliased and connected to the StorageGRID Admin Network (eth1).

. Select *Hardware* to see more information about the appliance.
 .. View the CPU Utilization and Memory graphs to determine the percentages of CPU and memory usage over time. To display a different time interval, select one of the controls above the chart or graph. You can display the information available for intervals of 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. You can also set a custom interval, which allows you to specify date and time ranges.
