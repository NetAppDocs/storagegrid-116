The Nodes page lists information about service health and all computational, disk device, and network resources for each appliance Storage Node. You can also see memory, storage hardware, controller firmware version, network resources, network interfaces, network addresses, and receive and transmit data.


.Steps
. From the Nodes page, select an appliance Storage Node.
. Select *Overview*.
+
The Node Information table on the Overview tab displays the node's ID and name, the node type, the software version installed, and the IP addresses associated with the node. The Interface column contains the name of the interface, as follows:

 ** *eth*: The Grid Network, Admin Network, or Client Network.
 ** *hic*: One of the physical 10, 25, or 100 GbE ports on the appliance. These ports can be bonded together and connected to the StorageGRID Grid Network (eth0) and Client Network (eth2).
 ** *mtc*: One of the physical 1 GbE ports on the appliance, which can be bonded or aliased and connected to the StorageGRID Admin Network (eth1).

. Select *Hardware* to see more information about the appliance.
 .. View the CPU Utilization and Memory graphs to determine the percentages of CPU and memory usage over time. To display a different time interval, select one of the controls above the chart or graph. You can display the information available for intervals of 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or 1 month. You can also set a custom interval, which allows you to specify date and time ranges.
+

 .. Scroll down to view the table of components for the appliance. This table contains information such as the model name of the appliance; controller names, serial numbers, and IP addresses; and the status of each component.
+
NOTE: Some fields, such as Compute Controller BMC IP and Compute Hardware, appear only for appliances with that feature.
+
Components for the storage shelves, and expansion shelves if they are part of the installation, appear in a separate table below the appliance table.

If a status is not "`Nominal,`" review any current alerts. You can also use SANtricity System Manager to learn more about some of these hardware values. See the instructions for installing and maintaining your appliance.

[start=4]
. Select *Network* to view information for each network.

The Network Traffic graph provides a summary of overall network traffic.
