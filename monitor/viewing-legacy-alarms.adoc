Alarms (legacy system) are triggered when system attributes reach alarm threshold values. You can view the currently active alarms from the Current Alarms page.

NOTE: While the legacy alarm system continues to be supported, the alert system offers significant benefits and is easier to use.

.What you'll need
* You must be signed in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].

.Steps
. Select *SUPPORT* > *Alarms (legacy)* > *Current alarms*.

. If you want to clear the count of current alarms, you can optionally do the following:
 ** Acknowledge the alarm. An acknowledged alarm is no longer included in the count of legacy alarms unless it is triggered at the next severity level or it is resolved and occurs again.
 ** Disable a particular Default alarm or Global Custom alarm for the entire system to prevent it from being triggered again.
