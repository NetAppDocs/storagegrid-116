 ** *Critical* image:../media/icon_alert_red_critical.png[Icon Alert Red Critical]: An abnormal condition exists that has stopped the normal operations of a StorageGRID node or service. You must address the underlying issue immediately. Service disruption and loss of data might result if the issue is not resolved.
 ** *Major* image:../media/icon_alert_orange_major.png[Icon Alert Orange Major]: An abnormal condition exists that is either affecting current operations or approaching the threshold for a critical alert. You should investigate major alerts and address any underlying issues to ensure that the abnormal condition does not stop the normal operation of a StorageGRID node or service.
 ** *Minor* image:../media/icon_alert_yellow_minor.png[Icon Alert Yellow Minor]: The system is operating normally, but an abnormal condition exists that could affect the system's ability to operate if it continues. You should monitor and resolve minor alerts that do not clear on their own to ensure they do not result in a more serious problem.
