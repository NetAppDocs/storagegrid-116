The Admin Network is optional. If you plan to configure an Admin Network, follow these requirements and guidelines.

Typical uses of the Admin Network include management connections, AutoSupport, KMS, and connections to critical servers such as NTP, DNS, and LDAP if these connections are not provided through the Grid Network or Client Network.

NOTE: The Admin Network and AESL can be unique to each node, as long as the desired network services and clients are reachable.

NOTE: You must define at least one subnet on the Admin Network to enable inbound connections from external subnets. Static routes are automatically generated on each node for each subnet in the AESL.
