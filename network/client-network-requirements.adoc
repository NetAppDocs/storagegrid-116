The Client Network is optional. If you plan to configure a Client Network, note the following considerations.

The Client Network is designed to support traffic from S3 and Swift clients. If configured, the Client Network gateway becomes the node's default gateway.

If you use a Client Network, you can help secure StorageGRID from hostile attacks by accepting inbound client traffic only on explicitly configured load balancer endpoints. See xref:..admin/managing-untrusted-client-network.adoc[Manage untrusted Client Networks] and xref:../admin/configuring-load-balancer-endpoints.adoc[Configure load balancer endpoints].
