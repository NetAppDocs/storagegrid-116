Depending on the deployment platforms you use, you might have additional considerations for your StorageGRID network design.

Grid nodes can be deployed as:

* Software-based grid nodes deployed as virtual machines in VMware
* Software-based grid nodes deployed within container engines on Linux hosts
* Appliance-based nodes

For additional information about grid nodes, see the xref:../primer/index.adoc[Grid primer].
