Depending on the deployment platforms you use, you might have additional considerations for your StorageGRID network design.

Grid nodes can be deployed as:

* Software-based grid nodes deployed as virtual machines in VMware vSphere Web Client
* Software-based grid nodes deployed within Docker containers on Linux hosts
* Appliance-based nodes

For additional information about grid nodes, see the _Grid primer_.
