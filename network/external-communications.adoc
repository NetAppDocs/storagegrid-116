[.lead]
Clients need to communicate with grid nodes to ingest and retrieve content. The ports used depends on the object storage protocols chosen. These ports need to be accessible to the client.

If enterprise networking policies restrict access to any of the ports, you can use load balancer endpoints to allow access on user-defined ports. The untrusted Client Networks feature can be used to allow access only on load balancer endpoint ports.

NOTE: To use systems and protocols such as SMTP, DNS, SSH, or DHCP, you must remap ports when deploying nodes. However, you should not remap balancer endpoints. For information about port remapping, see the installation instructions for your platform.

The following table shows the ports used for traffic into the nodes.

NOTE: This list does not include ports that might be configured as load balancer endpoints. For more information, see the instructions for configuring load balancer endpoints.
