Follow these requirements and guidelines for network gateways or routers.

* If set, the gateway for a given network must be within the specific network's subnet.
* If you configure an interface using static addressing, you must specify a gateway address other than 0.0.0.0.
* If you do not have a gateway, the best practice is to set the gateway address to be the IP address of the network interface.
