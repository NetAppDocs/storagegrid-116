In addition to the required Grid Network, you can choose whether to configure Admin Network and Client Network interfaces when designing the network topology for a single or multi-site deployment.

Internal ports are only accessible over the Grid Network. External ports are accessible from all network types. This flexibility provides multiple options for designing a StorageGRID deployment and setting up external IP and port filtering in switches and firewalls. For more information about internal and external ports, see the xref:network-port-reference.adoc[Network port reference].
