Follow these requirements and guidelines for network subnets.

IMPORTANT: Each network must be connected to its own subnet that does not overlap with any other network on the node.

The following restrictions are enforced by the Grid Manager during deployment. They are provided here to assist in pre-deployment network planning.

* The subnet mask for any network IP address cannot be 255.255.255.254 or 255.255.255.255 (/31 or /32 in CIDR notation).
* The subnet defined by a network interface IP address and subnet mask (CIDR) cannot overlap the subnet of any other interface configured on the same node.
* The Grid Network subnet for each node must be included in the GNSL.
* The Admin Network subnet cannot overlap the Grid Network subnet, the Client Network subnet, or any subnet in the GNSL.
* The subnets in the AESL cannot overlap with any subnets in the GNSL.
* The Client Network subnet cannot overlap the Grid Network subnet, the Admin Network subnet, any subnet in the GNSL, or any subnet in the AESL.
