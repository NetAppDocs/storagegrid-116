A StorageGRID system consists of multiple types of grid nodes at one or more data center sites.

For additional information about StorageGRID network topology, requirements, and grid communications, see the xref:../network/index.adoc[Networking guidelines]. 

== Deployment topologies

The StorageGRID system can be deployed to a single data center site or to multiple data center sites.

=== Single site

In a deployment with a single site, the infrastructure and operations of the StorageGRID system are centralized.

image::../media/data_center_site_single.png[Single Data Center Site]

=== Multiple sites

In a deployment with multiple sites, different types and numbers of StorageGRID resources can be installed at each site. For example, more storage might be required at one data center than at another.

Different sites are often located in geographically different locations across different failure domains, such as an earthquake fault line or flood plain. Data sharing and disaster recovery are achieved by automated distribution of data to other sites.

Multiple logical sites can also exist within a single data center to allow the use of distributed replication and erasure coding for increase availability and resiliency.

=== Grid node redundancy

In a single-site or multi-site deployment, you can optionally include more than one Admin Node or Gateway Node for redundancy. For example, you can install more than one Admin Node at a single site or across several sites. However, each StorageGRID system can only have one primary Admin Node.

== System architecture

This diagram shows how grid nodes are arranged within a StorageGRID system.

image::../media/grid_nodes_and_components.png[diagram described by surrounding text]

S3 and Swift clients store and retrieve objects in StorageGRID. Other clients are used to send email notifications, to access the StorageGRID management interface, and optionally to access the audit share.

S3 and Swift clients can connect to a Gateway Node or an Admin Node to use the load-balancing interface to Storage Nodes. Alternatively, S3 and Swift clients can connect directly to Storage Nodes using HTTPS.

Objects can be stored within StorageGRID on software or hardware-based Storage Nodes, on external archival media such as tape, or in Cloud Storage Pools, which consist of external S3 buckets or Azure Blob storage containers.


== Grid nodes and services

The basic building block of a StorageGRID system is the grid node. Nodes contain services, which are software modules that provide a set of capabilities to a grid node.

The StorageGRID system uses four types of grid nodes:

* *Admin Nodes* provide management services such as system configuration, monitoring, and logging. When you sign in to the Grid Manager, you are connecting to an Admin Node. Each grid must have one primary Admin Node and might have additional non-primary Admin Nodes for redundancy. You can connect to any Admin Node, and each Admin Node displays a similar view of the StorageGRID system. However, maintenance procedures must be performed using the primary Admin Node.
+
Admin Nodes can also be used to load balance S3 and Swift client traffic.

* *Storage Nodes* manage and store object data and metadata. Each StorageGRID system must have at least three Storage Nodes. If you have multiple sites, each site within your StorageGRID system must also have three Storage Nodes.
* *Gateway Nodes (optional)* provide a load-balancing interface that client applications can use to connect to StorageGRID. A load balancer seamlessly directs clients to an optimal Storage Node, so that the failure of nodes or even an entire site is transparent. You can use a combination of Gateway Nodes and Admin Nodes for load balancing, or you can implement a third-party HTTP load balancer.
* *Archive Nodes (optional)* provide an interface through which object data can be archived to tape.

To learn more, see xref:../admin/index.adoc[Administer StorageGRID].

=== Software-based nodes

Software-based grid nodes can be deployed in the following ways:

* As virtual machines (VMs) in VMware vSphere
* Within container engines on Linux hosts. The following operating systems are supported:
 ** Red Hat Enterprise Linux
 ** CentOS
 ** Ubuntu
 ** Debian

See the following for more information:

* xref:../vmware/index.adoc[Install VMware]

* xref:../rhel/index.adoc[Install Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS]

* xref:../ubuntu/index.adoc[Install Ubuntu or Debian]

=== StorageGRID appliance nodes

StorageGRID hardware appliances are specially designed for use in a StorageGRID system. Some appliances can be used as Storage Nodes. Other appliances can be used as Admin Nodes or Gateway Nodes. You can combine appliance nodes with software-based nodes or deploy fully engineered, all-appliance grids that have no dependencies on external hypervisors, storage, or compute hardware.

Four types of StorageGRID appliances are available:

* The *SG100 and SG1000 services appliances* are 1-rack-unit (1U) servers that can each operate as the primary Admin Node, a non-primary Admin Node, or a Gateway Node. Both appliances can operate as Gateway Nodes and Admin Nodes (primary and non-primary) at the same time.
* The *SG6000 storage appliance* operates as a Storage Node and combines the 1U SG6000-CN compute controller with a 2U or 4U storage controller shelf. The SG6000 is available in two models:
 ** *SGF6024*: Combines the SG6000-CN compute controller with a 2U storage controller shelf that includes 24 solid state drives (SSDs) and redundant storage controllers.
 ** *SG6060*: Combines the SG6000-CN compute controller with a 4U enclosure that includes 58 NL-SAS drives, 2 SSDs, and redundant storage controllers. Each SG6060 appliance supports one or two 60-drive expansion shelves, providing up to 178 drives dedicated to object storage.
* The *SG5700 storage appliance* is an integrated storage and computing platform that operates as a Storage Node. The SG5700 is available in two models:
 ** *SG5712*: a 2U enclosure that includes 12 NL-SAS drives and integrated storage and compute controllers.
 ** *SG5760*: a 4U enclosure that includes 60 NL-SAS drives and integrated storage and compute controllers.
* The *SG5600 storage appliance* is an integrated storage and computing platform that operates as a Storage Node. The SG5600 is available in two models:
 ** *SG5612*: a 2U enclosure that includes 12 NL-SAS drives and integrated storage and compute controllers.
 ** *SG5660*: a 4U enclosure that includes 60 NL-SAS drives and integrated storage and compute controllers.
