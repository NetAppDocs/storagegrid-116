You must install Linux on all grid hosts. Use the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to get a list of supported versions.

.Steps

. Install Linux on all physical or virtual grid hosts according to the distributor's instructions or your standard procedure.
+
NOTE: If you are using the standard Linux installer, NetApp recommends selecting the "`compute node`" software configuration, if available, or "`minimal install`" base environment. Do not install any graphical desktop environments.

. Ensure that all hosts have access to package repositories, including the Extras channel.
+
You might need these additional packages later in this installation procedure.

. If swap is enabled:
 .. Run the following command: `$ sudo swapoff --all`
 .. Remove all swap entries from `/etc/fstab` to persist the settings.

+
IMPORTANT: Failing to disable swap entirely can severely lower performance.
