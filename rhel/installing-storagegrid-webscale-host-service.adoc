You use the StorageGRID RPM package to install the StorageGRID host services.

.About this task

These instructions describe how to install the host services from the RPM packages. As an alternative, you can use the Yum repository metadata included in the installation archive to install the RPM packages remotely. See the Yum repository instructions for your Linux operating system.

.Steps

. Copy the StorageGRID RPM packages to each of your hosts, or make them available on shared storage.
+
For example, place them in the `/tmp` directory, so you can use the example command in the next step.

. Log in to each host as root or using an account with sudo permission, and run the following commands in the order specified:
+
----
sudo yum --nogpgcheck localinstall /tmp/StorageGRID-Webscale-Images-version-SHA.rpm
----
+
----
sudo yum --nogpgcheck localinstall /tmp/StorageGRID-Webscale-Service-version-SHA.rpm
----
+
IMPORTANT: You must install the Images package first, and the Service package second.
+
NOTE: If you placed the packages in a directory other than `/tmp`, modify the command to reflect the path you used.
