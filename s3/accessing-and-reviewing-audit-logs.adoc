Audit messages are generated by StorageGRID services and stored in text log files. API-specific audit messages in the audit logs provide critical security, operation, and performance monitoring data that can help you evaluate the health of your system.

.What you'll need
* You have specific access permissions.
* You have the `Passwords.txt` file.
* You know the IP address of an Admin Node.

.About this task
The active audit log file is named `audit.log`, and it is stored on Admin Nodes.

Once a day, the active audit.log file is saved, and a new `audit.log` file is started. The name of the saved file indicates when it was saved, in the format `_yyyy-mm-dd.txt_`.

After a day, the saved file is compressed and renamed, in the format `_yyyy-mm-dd.txt.gz_`, which preserves the original date.

This example shows the active `audit.log` file, the previous day's file (`2018-04-15.txt`), and the compressed file for the prior day (`2018-04-14.txt.gz`).
