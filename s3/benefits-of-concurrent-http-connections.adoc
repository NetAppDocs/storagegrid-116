You should keep multiple TCP/IP connections to the StorageGRID system open to allow parallelism, which increases performance. The optimal number of parallel connections depends on a variety of factors.

Concurrent HTTP connections provide the following benefits:

* Reduced latency
+
Transactions can start immediately instead of waiting for other transactions to be completed.

* Increased throughput
+
The StorageGRID system can perform parallel transactions and increase aggregate transaction throughput.

Client applications should establish multiple HTTP connections. When a client application has to perform a transaction, it can select and immediately use any established connection that is not currently processing a transaction.

Each StorageGRID system's topology has different peak throughput for concurrent transactions and connections before performance begins to degrade. Peak throughput depends on factors such as computing resources, network resources, storage resources, and WAN links. The number of servers and services and the number of applications that the StorageGRID system supports are also factors.

StorageGRID systems often support multiple client applications. You should keep this in mind when you determine the maximum number of concurrent connections used by a client application. If the client application consists of multiple software entities that each establish connections to the StorageGRID system, you should add up all the connections across the entities. You might have to adjust the maximum number of concurrent connections in the following situations:

* The StorageGRID system's topology affects the maximum number of concurrent transactions and connections that the system can support.
* Client applications that interact with the StorageGRID system over a network with limited bandwidth might have to reduce the degree of concurrency to ensure that individual transactions are completed in a reasonable time.
* When many client applications share the StorageGRID system, you might have to reduce the degree of concurrency to avoid exceeding the limits of the system.
