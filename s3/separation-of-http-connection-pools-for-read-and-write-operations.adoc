You can use separate pools of HTTP connections for read and write operations and control how much of a pool to use for each. Separate pools of HTTP connections enable you to better control transactions and balance loads.

Client applications can create loads that are retrieve-dominant (read) or store-dominant (write). With separate pools of HTTP connections for read and write transactions, you can adjust how much of each pool to dedicate for read or write transactions.
