[.lead]
There are operations added on to the S3 REST API that are specific to StorageGRID system.

== GET Bucket consistency request

The GET Bucket consistency request allows you to determine the consistency level being applied to a particular bucket.

The default consistency controls are set to guarantee read-after-write for newly created objects.

You have the s3:GetBucketConsistency permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

=== Request example

[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
GET /bucket?x-ntap-sg-consistency HTTP/1.1
Date: _date_
Authorization: _authorization string_
Host: _host_
----

=== Response

In the response XML, `<Consistency>` will return one of the following values:

[options="header"]
|===
| Consistency control| Description
a|
all
a|
All nodes receive the data immediately, or the request will fail.
a|
strong-global
a|
Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites.
a|
strong-site
a|
Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.
a|
read-after-new-write
a|
(Default) Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Matches Amazon S3 consistency guarantees.

*Note:* If your application uses HEAD requests on objects that do not exist, you might receive a high number of 500 Internal Server errors if one or more Storage Nodes are unavailable. To prevent these errors, set the consistency control to "`available`" unless you require consistency guarantees similar to Amazon S3.

a|
available (eventual consistency for HEAD operations)
a|
Behaves the same as the "`read-after-new-write`" consistency level, but only provides eventual consistency for HEAD operations. Offers higher availability for HEAD operations than "`read-after-new-write`" if Storage Nodes are unavailable. Differs from Amazon S3 consistency guarantees for HEAD operations only.
|===

=== Response example

== PUT Bucket consistency request

The PUT Bucket consistency request allows you to specify the consistency level to apply to operations performed on a bucket.

The default consistency controls are set to guarantee read-after-write for newly created objects.

You have the s3:PutBucketConsistency permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

=== Request

The `x-ntap-sg-consistency` parameter must contain one of the following values:

[options="header"]
|===
| Consistency control| Description
a|
all
a|
All nodes receive the data immediately, or the request will fail.
a|
strong-global
a|
Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites.
a|
strong-site
a|
Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.
a|
read-after-new-write
a|
(Default) Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees. Matches Amazon S3 consistency guarantees.

*Note:* If your application uses HEAD requests on objects that do not exist, you might receive a high number of 500 Internal Server errors if one or more Storage Nodes are unavailable. To prevent these errors, set the consistency control to "`available`" unless you require consistency guarantees similar to Amazon S3.

Offers higher availability for HEAD operations than "`read-after-new-write`" if Storage Nodes are unavailable. Differs from Amazon S3 consistency guarantees for HEAD operations only.
|===
*Note:* In general, you should use the "`read-after-new-write`" consistency control value. If requests are not working correctly, change the application client behavior if possible. Or, configure the client to specify the consistency control for each API request. Set the consistency control at the bucket level only as a last resort.

== GET Bucket last access time request

The GET Bucket last access time request allows you to determine if last access time updates are enabled or disabled for individual buckets.

You have the s3:GetBucketLastAccessTime permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

=== Request example

[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
GET /bucket?x-ntap-sg-lastaccesstime HTTP/1.1
Date: _date_
Authorization: _authorization string_
Host: _host_

</LastAccessTime>
----

== PUT Bucket last access time request

The PUT Bucket last access time request allows you to enable or disable last access time updates for individual buckets. Disabling last access time updates improves performance, and is the default setting for all buckets created with version 10.3.0, or later.

You have the s3:PutBucketLastAccessTime permission for a bucket, or be account root, to complete this operation.

NOTE: Starting with StorageGRID version 10.3, updates to last access time are disabled by default for all new buckets. If you have buckets that were created using an earlier version of StorageGRID and you want to match the new default behavior, you must explicitly disable last access time updates for each of those earlier buckets. You can enable or disable updates to last access time using the PUT Bucket last access time request, the *S3* > *Buckets* > *Change Last Access Setting* check box in the Tenant Manager, or the Tenant Management API.

If last access time updates are disabled for a bucket, the following behavior is applied to operations on the bucket:

* GET Object, GET Object ACL, GET Object Tagging, and HEAD Object requests do not update last access time. The object is not added to queues for information lifecycle management (ILM) evaluation.
* PUT Object - Copy and PUT Object Tagging requests that update only the metadata also update last access time. The object is added to queues for ILM evaluation.
* If updates to last access time are disabled for the source bucket, PUT Object - Copy requests do not update last access time for the source bucket. The object that was copied is not added to queues for ILM evaluation for the source bucket. However, for the destination, PUT Object - Copy requests always update last access time. The copy of the object is added to queues for ILM evaluation.
* Complete Multipart Upload requests update last access time. The completed object is added to queues for ILM evaluation.

=== Request examples

This example enables last access time for a bucket.

== GET Bucket metadata notification configuration request

The GET Bucket metadata notification configuration request allows you to retrieve the configuration XML used to configure search integration for individual buckets.

You have the s3:GetBucketMetadataNotification permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

=== Request example

This request retrieves the metadata notification configuration for the bucket named `bucket`.

[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
GET /bucket?x-ntap-sg-metadata-notification HTTP/1.1
Date: _date_
Authorization: _authorization string_
Host: _host_
----

=== Response

The response body includes the metadata notification configuration for the bucket. The metadata notification configuration lets you determine how the bucket is configured for search integration. That is, it allows you to determine which objects are indexed, and which endpoints their object metadata is being sent to.

----
<MetadataNotificationConfiguration>
    <Rule>
        <ID>Rule-1</ID>
        <Status>rule-status</Status>

== PUT Bucket metadata notification configuration request

The PUT Bucket metadata notification configuration request allows you to enable the search integration service for individual buckets. The metadata notification configuration XML that you supply in the request body specifies the objects whose metadata is sent to the destination search index.

You have the s3:PutBucketMetadataNotification permission for a bucket, or be account root, to complete this operation.

=== Request

The request must include the metadata notification configuration in the request body. Each metadata notification configuration includes one or more rules. Each rule specifies the objects that it applies to, and the destination where StorageGRID should send object metadata.

Objects can be filtered on the prefix of the object name. For example, you could send metadata for objects with the prefix `/images` to one destination, and objects with the prefix `/videos` to another.

Configurations that have overlapping prefixes are not valid, and are rejected when they are submitted. For example, a configuration that included one rule for for objects with the prefix `test` and a second rule for objects with the prefix `test2` would not be allowed.

Destinations must be specified using the URN of a StorageGRID endpoint. The endpoint must exist when the metadata notification configuration is submitted, or the request fails as a `400 Bad Request`. The error message states: `Unable to save the metadata notification (search) policy. The specified endpoint URN does not exist: _URN_.`

----

=== JSON generated by the search integration service

When you enable the search integration service for a bucket, a JSON document is generated and sent to the destination endpoint each time object metadata or tags are added, updated, or deleted.

This example shows an example of the JSON that could be generated when an object with the key `SGWS/Tagging.txt` is created in a bucket named `test`. The `test` bucket is not versioned, so the `versionId` tag is empty.

----
{
  "bucket": "test",
  "key": "SGWS/Tagging.txt",
  "versionId": "",
  "accountId": "86928401983529626822",
  "size": 38,
  "md5": "3d6c7634a85436eee06d43415012855",
  "region":"us-east-1"
  "metadata": {
    "age": "25"
  },
  "tags": {
    "color": "yellow"
  }
}
----

=== Object metadata included in metadata notifications

The table lists all the fields that are included in the JSON document that is sent to the destination endpoint when search integration is enabled.

The document name includes the bucket name, object name, and version ID if present.

[options="header"]
|===
| Type| Item name| Description
a|
Bucket and object information
a|
bucket
a|
Name of the bucket
a|
Bucket and object information
a|
key
a|
Object key name
a|
Bucket and object information
a|
versionID
a|
Object version, for objects in versioned buckets
a|
Bucket and object information
a|
region
a|
Bucket region, for example `us-east-1`
a|
System metadata
a|
size
a|
Object size (in bytes) as visible to an HTTP client
a|
System metadata
a|
md5
a|
Object hash
a|
User metadata
a|
metadata
`_key:value_`
a|
All user metadata for the object, as key-value pairs
a|
Tags
a|
tags
`_key:value_`
a|
All object tags defined for the object, as key-value pairs
|===
*Note:* For tags and user metadata, StorageGRID passes dates and numbers to Elasticsearch as strings or as S3 event notifications. To configure Elasticsearch to interpret these strings as dates or numbers, follow the Elasticsearch instructions for dynamic field mapping and for mapping date formats. You must enable the dynamic field mappings on the index before you configure the search integration service. After a document is indexed, you cannot edit the document's field types in the index.

== GET Storage Usage request

The GET Storage Usage request tells you the total amount of storage in use by an account, and for each bucket associated with the account.

The amount of storage used by an account and its buckets can be obtained by a modified GET Service request with the `x-ntap-sg-usage` query parameter. Bucket storage usage is tracked separately from the PUT and DELETE requests processed by the system. There might be some delay before the usage values match the expected values based on the processing of requests, particularly if the system is under heavy load.

By default, StorageGRID attempts to retrieve usage information using strong-global consistency. If strong-global consistency cannot be achieved, StorageGRID attempts to retrieve the usage information at a strong-site consistency.

You have the s3:ListAllMyBuckets permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

=== Request example

[source]
[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
GET /?x-ntap-sg-usage HTTP/1.1
Date: _date_

== Deprecated bucket requests for legacy Compliance

You might need to use the StorageGRID S3 REST API to manage buckets that were created using the legacy Compliance feature.

=== Compliance feature deprecated

The StorageGRID Compliance feature that was available in previous StorageGRID versions is deprecated and has been replaced by S3 Object Lock.

If you previously enabled the global Compliance setting, the global S3 Object Lock setting is enabled automatically when you upgrade to StorageGRID 11.5. You can no longer create new buckets with Compliance enabled; however, as required, you can use the StorageGRID S3 REST API to manage any existing legacy Compliant buckets.

The PUT Bucket compliance request is deprecated. However, you can continue to use this request to modify the compliance settings for an existing legacy Compliant bucket. For example, you can place an existing bucket on legal hold or increase its retention period.

IMPORTANT: The StorageGRID Compliance feature that was available in previous StorageGRID versions is deprecated and has been replaced by S3 Object Lock.

You have the s3:PutBucketCompliance permission, or be account root, to complete this operation.

You must specify a value for every field of the compliance settings when issuing a PUT Bucket compliance request.

==== Request example

This example request modifies the compliance settings for the bucket named `mybucket`. In this example, objects in `mybucket` will now be retained for two years (1,051,200 minutes) instead of one year, starting from when the object is ingested into the grid. There is no legal hold on this bucket. Each object will be automatically deleted after two years.

| Name| Description
a|
RetentionPeriodMinutes
a|
The length of the retention period for objects added to this bucket, in minutes. The retention period starts when the object is ingested into the grid.

*Attention:* When specifying a new value for RetentionPeriodMinutes, you must specify a value that is equal to or greater than the bucket's current retention period. After the bucket's retention period is set, you cannot decrease that value; you can only increase it.

a|
LegalHold
a|

* True: This bucket is currently under a legal hold. Objects in this bucket cannot be deleted until the legal hold is lifted, even if their retention period has expired.
* False: This bucket is not currently under a legal hold. Objects in this bucket can be deleted when their retention period expires.

a|
AutoDelete
a|

* True: The objects in this bucket will be deleted automatically when their retention period expires, unless the bucket is under a legal hold.
* False: The objects in this bucket will not be deleted automatically when the retention period expires. You must delete these objects manually if you need to delete them.

==== Consistency level for compliance settings

When you update the compliance settings for an S3 bucket with a PUT Bucket compliance request, StorageGRID attempts to update the bucket's metadata across the grid. By default, StorageGRID uses the *strong-global* consistency level to guarantee that all data center sites and all Storage Nodes that contain bucket metadata have read-after-write consistency for the changed compliance settings.

If StorageGRID cannot achieve the *strong-global* consistency level because a data center site or multiple Storage Nodes at a site are unavailable, the HTTP status code for the response is `503 Service Unavailable.`

If you receive this response, you must contact the grid administrator to ensure that the required storage services are made available as soon as possible. If the grid administrator is unable to make enough of the Storage Nodes at each site available, technical support might direct you to retry the failed request by forcing the *strong-site* consistency level.

IMPORTANT: Never force the *strong-site* consistency level for PUT bucket compliance unless you have been directed to do so by technical support and unless you understand the potential consequences of using this level.

When the consistency level is reduced to *strong-site*, StorageGRID guarantees that updated compliance settings will have read-after-write consistency only for client requests within a site. This means that the StorageGRID system might temporarily have multiple, inconsistent settings for this bucket until all sites and Storage Nodes are available. The inconsistent settings can result in unexpected and undesired behavior. For example, if you are placing a bucket under a legal hold and you force a lower consistency level, the bucket's previous compliance settings (that is, legal hold off) might continue to be in effect at some data center sites. As a result, objects that you think are on legal hold might be deleted when their retention period expires, either by the user or by AutoDelete, if enabled.

To force the use of the *strong-site* consistency level, reissue the PUT Bucket compliance request and include the `Consistency-Control` HTTP request header, as follows:

----
PUT /mybucket/?x-ntap-sg-compliance HTTP/1.1
Consistency-Control: strong-site
----

==== Error responses

* If the bucket was not created to be compliant, the HTTP status code for the response is `404 Not Found`.
* If `RetentionPeriodMinutes` in the request is less than the bucket's current retention period, the HTTP status code is `400 Bad Request`.
