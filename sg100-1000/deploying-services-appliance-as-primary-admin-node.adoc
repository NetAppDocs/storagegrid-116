When you deploy a services appliance as a primary Admin Node, you use the StorageGRID Appliance Installer included on the appliance to install the StorageGRID software, or you upload the software version you want to install. You must install and configure the primary Admin Node before you install any other appliance node types. A primary Admin Node can connect to the Grid Network, and to the optional Admin Network and Client Network, if one or both are configured.

.What you'll need

* The appliance has been installed in a rack or cabinet, connected to your networks, and powered on.
* Network links, IP addresses, and port remapping (if necessary) have been configured for the appliance using the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
IMPORTANT: If you have remapped any ports, you cannot use the same ports to configure load balancer endpoints. You can create endpoints using remapped ports, but those endpoints will be remapped to the original CLB ports and service, not the Load Balancer service. Follow the steps in xref:../maintain/removing-port-remaps.adoc[Remove port remaps].
+
See xref:../admin/how-load-balancing-works-clb-service.adoc[How load balancing works - CLB service (deprecated)] for more information on the CLB service.
+
NOTE: The CLB service is deprecated.

* You have a service laptop with a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You know one of the IP addresses assigned to the appliance. You can use the IP address for any attached StorageGRID network.

.About this task

To install StorageGRID on an appliance primary Admin Node:

* You use the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to install the StorageGRID software. If you want to install a different version of the software, you first upload it using the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
* You wait as the software is installed.
* When the software has been installed, the appliance is rebooted automatically.
