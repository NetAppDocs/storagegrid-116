As you install and configure the StorageGRID appliance, you must make decisions and gather information about Ethernet switch ports, IP addresses, and port and network bond modes. Record the required information for each network you connect to the appliance. These values are required to install and configure the hardware.

== Administration and maintenance ports

The Admin Network for StorageGRID is an optional network, used for system administration and maintenance. The appliance connects to the Admin Network using the following 1-GbE management ports on the appliance.

*SG100 RJ-45 ports*

*SG1000 RJ-45 ports*

| Information needed| Your value
a|
Admin Network enabled
a|
Choose one:

* No
* Yes (default)

a|
Network bond mode
a|
Choose one:

* Independent (default)
* Active-Backup

a|
Switch port for the left port circled in the diagram (default active port for Independent network bond mode)
a|

a|
Switch port for the right port circled in the diagram (Active-Backup network bond mode only)

MAC address for the Admin Network port

*Note:* The MAC address label on the front of the appliance lists the MAC address for the BMC management port. To determine the MAC address for the Admin Network port, you must add *2* to the hexadecimal number on the label. For example, if the MAC address on the label ends in *09*, the MAC address for the Admin Port would end in *0B*. If the MAC address on the label ends in *(_y_)FF*, the MAC address for the Admin Port would end in *(_y_+1)01*. You can easily make this calculation by opening Calculator in Windows, setting it to Programmer mode, selecting Hex, typing the MAC address, then typing *+ 2 =*.

a|
DHCP-assigned IP address for the Admin Network port, if available after power on

*Note:* You can determine the DHCP-assigned IP address by using the MAC address to look up the assigned IP.

a|

* IPv4 address (CIDR):
* Gateway:

a|
Static IP address you plan to use for the appliance node on the Admin Network

*Note:* If your network does not have a gateway, specify the same static IPv4 address for the gateway.

* IPv4 address (CIDR):
* Gateway:

a|
Admin Network subnets (CIDR)

== Networking ports

The four networking ports on the appliance connect to the StorageGRID Grid Network and the optional Client Network.

*Networking connections*

| Information needed| Your value
a|
Link speed

a|
For the SG100, choose one of the following:

* Auto (default)

* 25 GbE

For the SG1000, choose one of the following:

* Auto (default)
* 10 GbE
* 25 GbE
* 40 GbE
* 100 GbE

*Note:* For the SG1000, 10- and 25-GbE speeds require the use of QSA adapters.

* IPv4 address (CIDR):
* Gateway:

a|
Grid Network subnets (CIDRs)
a|

a|
Maximum transmission unit (MTU) setting (optional)You can use the default value of 1500, or set the MTU to a value suitable for jumbo frames, such as 9000.
