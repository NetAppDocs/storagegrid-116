You might need to reboot the services appliance while the StorageGRID Appliance Installer is running. For example, you might need to reboot the services appliance if the installation fails.

.About this task

This procedure only applies when the services appliance is running the StorageGRID Appliance Installer. Once the installation is completed, this step no longer works because the StorageGRID Appliance Installer is no longer available.

.Steps

. From the menu bar of the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, click *Advanced* > *Reboot Controller*.
+
The Reboot Controller page appears.

. From the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, click *Advanced* > *Reboot Controller*, and then select one of these options:
 ** Select *Reboot into StorageGRID* to reboot the controller with the node rejoining the grid. Select this option if you are done working in maintenance mode and are ready to return the node to normal operation.
 ** Select *Reboot into Maintenance Mode* to reboot the controller with the node remaining in maintenance mode. Select this option if there are additional maintenance operations you need to perform on the node before rejoining the grid.
