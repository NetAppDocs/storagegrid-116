If you cannot connect to the services appliance, there might be a network issue, or the hardware installation might not have been completed successfully.

.Steps

. Try to ping the appliance using the IP address for the appliance : +
`*ping _services_appliance_IP_*`
. If you receive no response from the ping, confirm you are using the correct IP address.
+
You can use the IP address of the appliance on the Grid Network, the Admin Network, or the Client Network.

. If the IP address is correct, check appliance cabling, QSFP or SFP transceivers, and the network setup.
+
If that does not resolve the issue, contact technical support.

. If the ping was successful, open a web browser.
. Enter the URL for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer: +
`*https://_appliances_controller_IP_:8443*`
+
The Home page appears.
