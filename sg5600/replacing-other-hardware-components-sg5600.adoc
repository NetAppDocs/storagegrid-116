You might need to replace a drive, fan, power supply, or battery in the StorageGRID appliance.

.What you'll need

* You have the E-Series hardware replacement procedure.
* The appliance has been xref:placing-appliance-into-maintenance-mode.adoc[placed in maintenance mode] if the component replacement procedure requires that you shut down the appliance.

.About this task

To replace a drive, power-fan canister, fan canister, power canister, battery, or drive drawer, refer to the standard procedures for the E2700 and E5600 storage arrays. Focus on the step-by-step instructions for removing and replacing the hardware itself; many of the SANtricity Storage Manager procedures do not apply to an appliance.
