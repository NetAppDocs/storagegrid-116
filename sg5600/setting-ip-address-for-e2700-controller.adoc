`*https://_E5600SG_Controller_IP_:8443*`
+
For `_E5600SG_Controller_IP_`, use the IP address for the appliance on any StorageGRID network.
+
The StorageGRID Appliance Installer Home page appears.

. Select *Hardware Configuration* > *Storage Controller Network Configuration*.
+
The Storage Controller Network Configuration page appears.

. Depending on your network configuration, select *Enabled* for IPv4, IPv6, or both.
