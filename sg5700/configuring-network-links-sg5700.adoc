[.lead]
You can configure network links for the ports used to connect the appliance to the Grid Network, the Client Network, and the Admin Network. You can set the link speed as well as the port and network bond modes.

.What you'll need

If you plan to use the 25-GbE link speed for the 10/25-GbE ports:

* You have installed SFP28 transceivers in the ports you plan to use.
* You have connected the ports to switches that can support these features.
* You understand how to configure the switches to use this higher speed.

If you plan to use Aggregate port bond mode, LACP network bond mode, or VLAN tagging for the 10/25-GbE ports:

* You have connected the ports on the appliance to switches that can support VLAN and LACP.
* If multiple switches are participating in the LACP bond, the switches support multi-chassis link aggregation groups (MLAG), or equivalent.
* You understand how to configure the switches to use VLAN, LACP, and MLAG or equivalent.
* You know the unique VLAN tag to use for each network. This VLAN tag will be added to each network packet to ensure that network traffic is routed to the correct network.
* If you plan to use Active-Backup mode for the Admin Network, you have connected Ethernet cables to both management ports on the controller.

.About this task

This figure shows how the four 10/25-GbE ports are bonded in Fixed port bond mode (default configuration).

The table summarizes the options for configuring the four 10/25-GbE ports. The default settings are shown in bold. You only need to configure the settings on the Link Configuration page if you want to use a non-default setting.

See the information about 10/25-GbE port connections for the E5700SG controller for more information about port bond and network bond modes.

This figure shows how the two 1-GbE management ports on the E5700SG controller are bonded in Active-Backup network bond mode for the Admin Network.

.Steps

. From the menu bar of the StorageGRID Appliance Installer, click *Configure Networking* > *Link Configuration*.
+
The Network Link Configuration page displays a diagram of your appliance with the network and management ports numbered.
+
image::../media/sg5712_configuring_network_ports.png[SG5712 Network and Management Ports]
+
The Link Status table lists the link state (up/down) and speed (1/10/25/40/100 Gbps) of the numbered ports.
+
image::../media/sg5712_configuring_network_linkstatus.png[SG5712 Link Status]
+
The first time you access this page:

 ** *Link Speed* is set to *10GbE*.
 ** *Port bond mode* is set to *Fixed*.
 ** *Network bond mode* for the Grid Network is set to *Active-Backup*.
 ** The *Admin Network* is enabled, and the network bond mode is set to *Independent*.
 ** The *Client Network* is disabled.

. If you plan to use the 25-GbE link speed for the 10/25 GbE ports, select *25GbE* from the Link speed drop-down list.
+
The network switches you are using for the Grid Network and the Client Network must also support and be configured for this speed. SFP28 transceivers must be installed in the ports.

. Enable or disable the StorageGRID networks you plan to use.
+
The Grid Network is required. You cannot disable this network.

 .. If the appliance is not connected to the Admin Network, unselect the *Enable network* check box for the Admin Network.
+
image::../media/admin_network_disabled.gif[Screenshot showing check box for enabling or disabling the Admin Network]

 .. If the appliance is connected to the Client Network, select the *Enable network* check box for the Client Network.
+
The Client Network settings for the 10/25-GbE ports are now shown.

. Refer to the table, and configure the port bond mode and the network bond mode.
+
The example shows:

 ** *Aggregate* and *LACP* selected for the Grid and the Client networks. You must specify a unique VLAN tag for each network. You can select values between 0 and 4095.
 ** *Active-Backup* selected for the Admin Network.
+

. When you are satisfied with your selections, click *Save*.
+
NOTE: You might lose your connection if you made changes to the network or link you are connected through. If you are not reconnected within 1 minute, re-enter the URL for the StorageGRID Appliance Installer using one of the other IP addresses assigned to the appliance: +
`*https://_E5700SG_Controller_IP_:8443*`
