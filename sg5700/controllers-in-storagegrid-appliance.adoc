Both the SG5712 and SG5760 models of the StorageGRID appliance include an E5700SG controller and an E2800 controller. You should review the diagrams to learn the differences between the controllers.

== E5700SG controller

* Operates as the compute server for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is accessed from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E2800 controller and operates as the initiator.

This figure shows the connectors on the back of the E5700SG controller.

== E2800 controller

* Operates as the storage controller for the appliance.
* Manages the storage of data on the drives.
* Functions as a standard E-Series controller in simplex mode.
* Includes SANtricity OS Software (controller firmware).
