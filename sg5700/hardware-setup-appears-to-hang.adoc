The StorageGRID Appliance Installer might not be available if hardware faults or cabling errors prevent the E5700SG controller from completing its boot-up processing.

.Steps

. Watch the codes on the seven-segment displays.

While the hardware is initializing during power up, the two seven-segment displays show a sequence of codes. When the hardware boots successfully, the seven-segment displays show different codes for each controller.

. Review the codes on the seven-segment display for the E5700SG controller.

NOTE: The installation and provisioning take time. Some installation phases do not report updates to the StorageGRID Appliance Installer for several minutes.
+
If an error occurs, the seven-segment display flashes a sequence, such as HE.

. To understand what these codes mean, see the following resources:
