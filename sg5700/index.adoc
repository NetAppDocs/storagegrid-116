The SG5700 StorageGRID appliance is an integrated storage and computing platform that operates as a Storage Node in a StorageGRID grid. The appliance can be used in a hybrid grid environment that combines appliance Storage Nodes and virtual (software-based) Storage Nodes.

StorageGRID SG5700 series appliance provides the following features:

* Integrate the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Include the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Includes E-Series SANtricity System Manager for hardware management and monitoring.
* Support up to four 10-GbE or 25-GbE connections to the StorageGRID Grid Network and Client Network.
* Support Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) drives. When these drives are used with the Drive Security feature in SANtricity System Manager, unauthorized access to data is prevented.

The SG5700 appliance is available in four models: the SG5712 and SG5712X, and the SG5760 and SG5760X. There are no specification or functional differences between the SG5712 and SG5712X except for the location of the interconnect ports on the storage controller. Similarly, there are no specification or functional differences between the SG5760 and SG5760X except for the location of the interconnect ports on the storage controller.  

The models include the following components:
