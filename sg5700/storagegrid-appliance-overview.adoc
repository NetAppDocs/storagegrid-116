The SG5700 StorageGRID appliance is an integrated storage and computing platform that operates as a Storage Node in a StorageGRID grid. The appliance can be used in a hybrid grid environment that combines appliance Storage Nodes and virtual (software-based) Storage Nodes.

The StorageGRID SG5700 appliance provides the following features:

* Integrates the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Includes E-Series SANtricity System Manager for hardware management and monitoring.
* Supports up to four 10-GbE or 25-GbE connections to the StorageGRID Grid Network and Client Network.
* Supports Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) drives. When these drives are used with the Drive Security feature in SANtricity System Manager, unauthorized access to data is prevented.

The SG5700 appliance is available in two models: the SG5712 and the SG5760. Both models include the following components:
