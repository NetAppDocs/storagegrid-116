If you are familiar with configuring SNMP for hardware, you can use the BMC interface to configure the SNMP settings for the SG6000-CN controller. You can provide secure community strings, enable SNMP Trap, and specify up to five SNMP destinations.

.What you'll need

* You know how to access the BMC dashboard.
* You have experience in configuring SNMP settings for SNMPv1-v2c equipment.

NOTE: BMC settings made by this procedure might not be preserved if the SG6000-CN fails and has to be replaced.  Make sure you have a record of all settings you have applied, so they can be easily reapplied after a hardware replacement if necessary.

.Steps

. From the BMC dashboard, select *Settings* > *SNMP Settings*.
. On the SNMP Settings page, select *Enable SNMP V1/V2*, and then provide a Read-Only Community String and a Read-Write Community String.
+
The Read-Only Community String is like a user ID or password. You should change this value to prevent intruders from getting information about your network setup. The Read-Write Community String protects the device against unauthorized changes.

. Optionally, select *Enable Trap*, and enter the required information.
+
IMPORTANT: Enter the Destination IP for each SNMP trap using an IP address. Fully qualified domain names are not supported.
+
Enable traps if you want the SG6000-CN controller to send immediate notifications to an SNMP console when it is in an unusual state. Traps might indicate hardware failures of various components or temperature thresholds being exceeded.

. Optionally, click *Send Test Trap* to test your settings.
. If the settings are correct, click *Save*.
