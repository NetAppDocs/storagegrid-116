. Connect these two power cords to two different power distribution units (PDUs) in the cabinet or rack.
. Connect a power cord to each of the two power supply units in the storage controller shelf.
. If you have expansion shelves, connect a power cord to each of the two power supply units in each expansion shelf.
. Connect the two power cords in each storage shelf (including the optional expansion shelves) to two different PDUs in the cabinet or rack.
