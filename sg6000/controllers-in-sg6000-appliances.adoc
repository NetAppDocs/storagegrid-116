Each model of the StorageGRID SG6000 appliance includes an SG6000-CN compute controller in a 1U enclosure and duplex E-Series storage controllers in a 2U or 4U enclosure, depending on the model. Review the diagrams to learn more about each type of controller.

== All appliances: SG6000-CN compute controller

* Provides compute resources for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is retrieved from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E-Series storage controllers and operates as the initiator.

This figure shows the connectors on the back of the SG6000-CN.

== SG6060 and SG6060X: E2800 series storage controllers
* Two controllers for failover support.
* Manage the storage of data on the drives.
* Function as standard E-Series controllers in a duplex configuration.
* Include SANtricity OS Software (controller firmware).
* Include SANtricity System Manager for monitoring storage hardware and for managing alerts, the AutoSupport feature, and the Drive Security feature.

Two E2800A storage controllers
a|
SG6060X

Two E2800B storage controllers
|===

The E2800A does not have a HIC, and the E2800B has a four-port HIC. The E2800A and the E2800B storage controllers are identical in specifications and function except for the location of the interconnect ports. 

CAUTION: Do not use an E2800A and an E2800B in the same appliance.

The following figures show the connectors on the back of each of the E2800 series controllers.
