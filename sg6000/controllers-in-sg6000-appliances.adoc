Each model of the StorageGRIDSG6000 appliance includes an SG6000-CN compute controller in a 1U enclosure and duplex E-Series storage controllers in a 2U or 4U enclosure, depending on the model. Review the diagrams to learn more about each type of controller.

== All appliances: SG6000-CN compute controller

* Provides compute resources for the appliance.
* Includes the StorageGRID Appliance Installer.
+
NOTE: StorageGRID software is not preinstalled on the appliance. This software is retrieved from the Admin Node when you deploy the appliance.

* Can connect to all three StorageGRID networks, including the Grid Network, the Admin Network, and the Client Network.
* Connects to the E-Series storage controllers and operates as the initiator.

This figure shows the connectors on the back of the SG6000-CN.
