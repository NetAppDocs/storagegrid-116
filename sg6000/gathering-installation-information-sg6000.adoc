[.lead]
As you install and configure the StorageGRID appliance, you must make decisions and gather information about Ethernet switch ports, IP addresses, and port and network bond modes.

.About this task

You can use the following tables to record the required information for each network you connect to the appliance. These values are required to install and configure the hardware.

== Information needed to connect to SANtricity System Manager on storage controllers

You must connect both of the storage controllers in the appliance (either the E2800 controllers or the EF570 controllers) to the management network you will use for SANtricity System Manager. The controllers are located in each appliance as follows:

* SG6060: Controller A is on the top, and controller B is on the bottom.
* SGF6024: Controller A is on the left, and controller B is on the right.

| Information needed| Your value for controller A| Your value for controller B
a|
Ethernet switch port you will connect to management port 1 (labeled as P1 on the controller)
a|

a|

a|
MAC address for management port 1 (printed on a label near port P1)
a|

a|

a|
DHCP-assigned IP address for management port 1, if available after power on

*Note:* If the network you will connect to the storage controller includes a DHCP server, the network administrator can use the MAC address to determine the IP address that was assigned by the DHCP server.

For IPv4:

* IPv4 address:
* Subnet mask:

== Information needed to connect SG6000-CN controller to Admin Network

The Admin Network for StorageGRID is an optional network, used for system administration and maintenance. The appliance connects to the Admin Network using the following 1-GbE management ports on the SG6000-CN controller.

[options="header"]
|===
| Information needed| Your value
a|
Admin Network enabled
a|
Choose one:

* No
* Yes (default)

a|
Network bond mode
a|
Choose one:

* Independent (default)
* Active-Backup

a|
Switch port for the left port in the red circle in the diagram (default active port for Independent network bond mode)
a|

a|
Switch port for the right port in the red circle in the diagram (Active-Backup network bond mode only)
a|

a|
MAC address for the Admin Network port

*Note:* The MAC address label on the front of the SG6000-CN controller lists the MAC address for the BMC management port. To determine the MAC address for the Admin Network port, you must add *2* to the hexadecimal number on the label. For example, if the MAC address on the label ends in *09*, the MAC address for the Admin Port would end in *0B*. If the MAC address on the label ends in *(_y_)FF*, the MAC address for the Admin Port would end in *(_y_+1)01*. You can easily make this calculation by opening Calculator in Windows, setting it to Programmer mode, selecting Hex, typing the MAC address, then typing *+ 2 =*.

a|

a|
DHCP-assigned IP address for the Admin Network port, if available after power on

*Note:* You can determine the DHCP-assigned IP address by using the MAC address to look up the assigned IP.

a|

* IPv4 address (CIDR):
* Gateway:

a|
Static IP address you plan to use for the appliance Storage Node on the Admin Network

*Note:* If your network does not have a gateway, specify the same static IPv4 address for the gateway.
