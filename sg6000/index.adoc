The StorageGRID SG6000 appliances are integrated storage and computing platforms that operate as Storage Nodes in a StorageGRID system. These appliances can be used in a hybrid grid environment that combines appliance Storage Nodes and virtual (software-based) Storage Nodes.

The SG6000 appliances provide the following features:

* Available in two models:
 ** SG6060, which includes 60 drives and supports expansion shelves.
 ** SGF6024, which offers 24 solid state drives (SSDs).
* Integrate the storage and computing elements for a StorageGRID Storage Node.
* Include the StorageGRID Appliance Installer to simplify Storage Node deployment and configuration.
* Include SANtricity System Manager for managing and monitoring the storage controllers and drives.
* Include a baseboard management controller (BMC) for monitoring and diagnosing the hardware in the compute controller.
* Support up to four 10-GbE or 25-GbE connections to the StorageGRID Grid Network and Client Network.
* Support Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) drives. When these drives are used with the Drive Security feature in SANtricity System Manager, unauthorized access to data is prevented.
