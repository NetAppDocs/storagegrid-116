You can install one or more StorageGRID storage appliances when you first deploy StorageGRID, or you can add appliance Storage Nodes later as part of an expansion. You might also need to install an appliance Storage Node as part of a recovery operation.

.What you'll need

Your StorageGRID system is using the required version of StorageGRID software.

[options="header"]
|===
| Appliance| Required StorageGRID version
a|
SG6060 with no expansion shelves
a|
11.1.1 or later
a|
SG6060 with expansion shelves (one or two)
a|
11.3 or later

*Note:* If you add expansion shelves after the initial deployment, you must use version 11.4 or later.

a|
SGF6024
a|
11.3 or later

== Installation and deployment tasks

Adding a StorageGRID storage appliance to a StorageGRID system includes four primary steps:

. Preparing for installation:
 ** Preparing the installation site
 ** Unpacking the boxes and checking the contents
 ** Obtaining additional equipment and tools
 ** Gathering IP addresses and network information
 ** Optional: Configuring an external key management server (KMS) if you plan to encrypt all appliance data. See details about external key management in the instructions for administering StorageGRID.
. Installing the hardware:
 ** Registering the hardware
 ** Installing the appliance into a cabinet or rack
 ** Installing the drives
 ** Installing optional expansion shelves (model SG6060 only; maximum of two expansion shelves)
 ** Cabling the appliance
 ** Connecting the power cords and applying power
 ** Viewing boot-up status codes
. Configuring the hardware:
 ** Accessing SANtricity System Manager to configure SANtricity System Manager settings
 ** Accessing StorageGRID Appliance Installer, setting a static IP address for management port 1 on the storage controller, and configuring the link and network IP settings required to connect to StorageGRID networks
 ** Accessing the baseboard management controller (BMC) interface on the SG6000-CN controller
 ** Optional: Enabling node encryption if you plan to use an external KMS to encrypt appliance data.
 ** Optional: Changing the RAID mode.
. Deploying the appliance as a Storage Node:
