+
The blue status bar indicates which task is currently in progress. Green status bars indicate tasks that have completed successfully.
+
NOTE: The installer ensures that tasks completed in a previous install are not re-run. If you are re-running an installation, any tasks that do not need to be re-run are shown with a green status bar and a status of "`Skipped.`"

. Review the progress of the first two installation stages.
+
*1. Configure storage*
+
During this stage, the installer connects to the storage controller, clears any existing configuration, communicates with SANtricity software to configure volumes, and configures host settings.
+
*2. Install OS*
+
During this stage, the installer copies the base operating system image for StorageGRID to the appliance.
. Continue monitoring the installation progress until the *Install StorageGRID* stage pauses and a message appears on the embedded console, prompting you to approve this node on the Admin Node using the Grid Manager. Go to the next step.

. Go to the Grid Manager of the Primary Admin node, approve the pending storage node, and complete the StorageGRID installation process.
+
When you click *Install* from the Grid Manager, Stage 3 completes and stage 4, *Finalize Installation*, begins. When stage 4 completes, the controller is rebooted.
