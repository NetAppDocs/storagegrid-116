= Network bond modes for 1-GbE management ports

[.lead]
For the two 1-GbE management ports on the SG6000-CN controller, you can choose Independent network bond mode or Active-Backup network bond mode to connect to the optional Admin Network.

In Independent mode, only the management port on the left is connected to the Admin Network. This mode does not provide a redundant path. The management port on the right is unconnected and available for temporary local connections (uses IP address 169.254.0.1)

In Active-Backup mode, both management ports are connected to the Admin Network. Only one port is active at a time. If the active port fails, its backup port automatically provides a failover connection. Bonding these two physical ports into one logical management port provides a redundant path to the Admin Network.

NOTE: If you need to make a temporary local connection to the SG6000-CN controller when the 1-GbE management ports are configured for Active-Backup mode, remove the cables from both management ports, plug your temporary cable into the management port on the right, and access the appliance using IP address 169.254.0.1.
