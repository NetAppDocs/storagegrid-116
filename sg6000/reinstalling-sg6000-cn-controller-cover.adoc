. Rotate the cover latch forward and down until it stops and the cover fully seats into the chassis. Verify that there are no gaps along the front edge of the cover.

. Optional: Turn the blue plastic latch lock one-quarter turn in the lock direction, as shown on the latch lock, to lock it.

.After you finish

Reinstall the controller in the cabinet or rack.
