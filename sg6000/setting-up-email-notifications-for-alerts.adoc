If you want email notifications to be sent when alerts occur, you must use the BMC interface to configure SMTP settings, users, LAN destinations, alert policies, and event filters.

NOTE: BMC settings made by this procedure might not be preserved if the SG6000-CN fails and has to be replaced. Make sure you have a record of all settings you have applied, so they can be easily reapplied after a hardware replacement if necessary.

.What you'll need

You know how to access the BMC dashboard.

.About this task

In the BMC interface, you use the *SMTP Settings*, *User Management*, and *Platform Event Filters* options on the Settings page to configure email notifications.

.Steps

. Configure the SMTP settings.
 .. Select *Settings* > *SMTP Settings*.
 .. For Sender Email ID, enter a valid email address.
+
This email address is provided as the From address when the BMC sends email.
. Set up users to receive alerts.
 .. From the BMC dashboard, select *Settings* > *User Management*.
 .. Add at least one user to receive alert notifications.
+
The email address you configure for a user is the address the BMC sends alert notifications to. For example, you could add a generic user, such as "`notification-user,`" and use the email address of a technical support team email distribution list.
. Configure the LAN destination for alerts.
 .. Select *Settings* > *Platform Event Filters* > *LAN Destinations*.
 .. Configure at least one LAN destination.
  *** Select *Email* as the Destination Type.
  *** For BMC Username, select a user name that you added earlier.
  *** If you added multiple users and want all of them to receive notification emails, you must add a LAN Destination for each user.
 .. Send a test alert.
. Configure alert policies so you can define when and where the BMC sends alerts.
 .. Select *Settings* > *Platform Event Filters* > *Alert Policies*.
 .. Configure at least one alert policy for each LAN destination.
  *** For Policy Group Number, select *1*.
  *** For Policy Action, select *Always send alert to this destination*.
  *** For LAN Channel, select *1*.
  *** In the Destination Selector, select the LAN destination for the policy.
. Configure event filters to direct alerts for different event types to the appropriate users.
 .. Select *Settings* > *Platform Event Filters* > *Event Filters*.
 .. For Alert Policy Group Number, enter *1*.
 .. Create filters for every event you want the Alert Policy Group to be notified about.
  *** You can create event filters for power actions, specific sensor events, or all events.
  *** If you are uncertain which events to monitor, select *All Sensors* for Sensor Type and *All Events* for Event Options. If you receive unwanted notifications, you can change your selections later.
