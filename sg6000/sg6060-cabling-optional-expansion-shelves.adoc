* You have installed the expansion shelves in the cabinet or rack that contains the E2860 controller shelf.

.Step

Connect each expansion shelf to the E2860 controller shelf as shown in the diagram.

This drawing shows the cabling for two expansion shelves in an SG6060 (the expansion cabling for the SG6060X is the same). If you have only one expansion shelf, connect IOM A to controller A and connect IOM B to controller B.
