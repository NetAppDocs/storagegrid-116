* The appliance has been xref:placing-appliance-into-maintenance-mode.adoc[placed into maintenance mode].

.About this task

To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before shutting down the controller or shut down the controller during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are acceptable. See the information about determining node connection states in the instructions for managing objects with information lifecycle management.

IMPORTANT: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object, you must shut down the controller during a scheduled maintenance window. Otherwise, you might temporarily lose access to those objects during this procedure.
