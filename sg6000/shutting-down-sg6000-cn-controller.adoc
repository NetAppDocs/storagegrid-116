.About this task

To prevent service interruptions, confirm that all other Storage Nodes are connected to the grid before shutting down the controller or shut down the controller during a scheduled maintenance window when periods of service disruption are normally expected. See the information about determining node connection states in the instructions for managing objects with information lifecycle management.

IMPORTANT: If you have ever used an ILM rule that creates only one copy of an object, you must shut down the controller during a scheduled maintenance window. Otherwise, you might temporarily lose access to those objects during this procedure. +
See information about managing objects with information lifecycle management.

.Steps

. When the appliance has been placed maintenance mode, shut down the SG6000-CN controller:
+
CAUTION: You must perform a controlled shut down of the controller by entering the commands specified below. Shutting down the controller using the power switch will result in data loss.

 .. Log in to the grid node using PuTTY or another ssh client:
  ... Enter the following command: `ssh admin@_grid_node_IP_`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
  ... Enter the following command to switch to root: `su -`
  ... Enter the password listed in the `Passwords.txt` file.
+
When you are logged in as root, the prompt changes from `$` to `#`.
 .. Shut down the SG6000-CN controller: +
`*shutdown -h now*`
+
This command might take up to 10 minutes to complete.
