To ensure optimal functioning of the storage controller, you must upgrade to the latest maintenance release of the SANtricity OS that is qualified for your StorageGRID appliance. Consult the NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool (IMT) to determine which version you should be using. If you need assistance, contact technical support.

Use one of the following procedures based on the version of SANtricity OS currently installed:

* If the storage controller is using SANtricity OS 08.42.20.00 (11.42) or newer, use the Grid Manager to perform the upgrade.

* If the storage controller is using a SANtricity OS version older than 08.42.20.00 (11.42), use maintenance mode to perform the upgrade.
