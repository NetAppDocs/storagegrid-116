Consistency level makes a trade-off between the availability of the objects and the consistency of those objects across different Storage Nodes and sites. The GET container consistency request allows you to determine the consistency level being applied to a particular container.

== Request

[options="header"]
|===
| Request HTTP Header| Description
a|
`X-Auth-Token`
a|
Specifies the Swift authentication token for the account to use for the request.
a|
`x-ntap-sg-consistency`
a|
Specifies the type of request, where `true` = GET container consistency, and `false` = GET container.
a|
`Host`
a|
The hostname to which the request is directed.

== Request example

----
GET /v1/28544923908243208806/Swift container
X-Auth-Token: SGRD_3a877009a2d24cb1801587bfa9050f29
x-ntap-sg-consistency: true
Host: test.com

== Response

[options="header"]
|===
| Response HTTP Header| Description
a|
`Date`
a|
The date and time of the response.
a|
`Connection`
a|
Whether the connection to the server is open or closed.
a|
`X-Trans-Id`
a|
The unique transaction identifier for the request.
a|
`Content-Length`
a|
The length of the response body.
a|
`x-ntap-sg-consistency`
a|
The consistency control level being applied to the container. The following values are supported:

* *all*: All nodes receive the data immediately or the request will fail.
* *strong-global*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests across all sites.
* *strong-site*: Guarantees read-after-write consistency for all client requests within a site.
* *read-after-new-write*: Provides read-after-write consistency for new objects and eventual consistency for object updates. Offers high availability and data protection guarantees.
+
*Note*: If your application uses HEAD requests on objects that do not exist, you might receive a high number of 500 Internal Server errors if one or more Storage Nodes are unavailable. To prevent these errors, use the "`available`" level.

* *available* (eventual consistency for HEAD operations): Behaves the same as the "`read-after-new-write`" consistency level, but only provides eventual consistency for HEAD operations. Offers higher availability for HEAD operations than "`read-after-new-write`" if Storage Nodes are unavailable.
