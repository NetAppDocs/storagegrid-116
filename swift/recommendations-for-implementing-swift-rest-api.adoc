You should follow these recommendations when implementing the Swift REST API for use with StorageGRID.

== Recommendations for HEADs to non-existent objects

If your application routinely checks to see if an object exists at a path where you do not expect the object to actually exist, you should use the "`Available`" consistency control. For example, you should use the "`Available`" consistency control if your application performs a HEAD operation to a location before performing a PUT operation to that location.

Otherwise, if the HEAD operation does not find the object, you might receive a high number of 500 Internal Server errors if one or more Storage Nodes are unavailable.

You can set the "`Available`" consistency control for each container using the PUT container consistency request.

== Recommendations for object names

You should not use random values as the first four characters of object names. Instead, you should use non-random, non-unique prefixes, such as image.

If you do need to use random and unique characters in object name prefixes, you should prefix the object names with a directory name. That is, use this format:

----
mycontainer/mydir/f8e3-image3132.jpg
----

Instead of this format:

----
mycontainer/f8e3-image3132.jpg

== Recommendations for "`range reads`"

If the *Compress Stored Objects* option is selected (*CONFIGURATION* > *System* > *Grid options*), Swift client applications should avoid performing GET object operations that specify a range of bytes be returned. These "`range read`" operations are inefficient because StorageGRID must effectively uncompress the objects to access the requested bytes. GET Object operations that request a small range of bytes from a very large object are especially inefficient; for example, it is very inefficient to read a 10 MB range from a 50 GB compressed object.

If ranges are read from compressed objects, client requests can time out.

NOTE: If you need to compress objects and your client application must use range reads, increase the read timeout for the application.
