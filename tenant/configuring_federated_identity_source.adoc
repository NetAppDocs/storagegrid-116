[.lead]
You can configure identity federation if you want tenant groups and users to be managed in another system such as Active Directory, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), OpenLDAP, or Oracle Directory Server.

== Configure identity federation
.What you'll need

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a xref:../admin/web_browser_requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have specific access permissions.
* You are using Active Directory, Azure AD, OpenLDAP, or Oracle Directory Server as the identity provider.
+
NOTE: If you want to use an LDAP v3 service that is not listed, contact technical support.

* If you plan to use OpenLDAP, you must configure the OpenLDAP server. See xref:../admin/using_identity_federation..adoc[Guidelines for configuring an OpenLDAP server].
* If you plan to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for communications with the LDAP server, the identity provider must be using TLS 1.2 or 1.3. See xref:../admin/supported_ciphers_for_outgoing_tls_connections.adoc[Supported ciphers for outgoing TLS connections].

.About this task

Whether you can configure an identity federation service for your tenant depends on how your tenant account was set up. Your tenant might share the identity federation service that was configured for the Grid Manager. If you see this message when you access the Identity Federation page, you cannot configure a separate federated identity source for this tenant.
