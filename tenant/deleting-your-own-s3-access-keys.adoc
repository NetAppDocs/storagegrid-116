If you are using an S3 tenant and you have the appropriate permission, you can delete your own S3 access keys. After an access key is deleted, it can no longer be used to access the objects and buckets in the tenant account.

.What you'll need
* You must be signed in to the Tenant Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You must have the Manage Your Own S3 Credentials permission. See xref:tenant-management-permissions.adoc[Tenant management permissions].


IMPORTANT: The S3 buckets and objects belonging to your account can be accessed using the access key ID and secret access key displayed for your account in the Tenant Manager. For this reason, protect access keys as you would a password. Rotate access keys on a regular basis, remove any unused keys from your account, and never share them with other users.

+
The My access keys page appears and lists any existing access keys.
