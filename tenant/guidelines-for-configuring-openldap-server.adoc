If you want to use an OpenLDAP server for identity federation, you must configure specific settings on the OpenLDAP server.

== Memberof and refint overlays

The memberof and refint overlays should be enabled. For more information, see the instructions for reverse group membership maintenance in the _OpenLDAP Software Administrator's Guide_.

== Indexing

You must configure the following OpenLDAP attributes with the specified index keywords:

----
olcDbIndex: objectClass eq
olcDbIndex: uid eq,pres,sub
olcDbIndex: cn eq,pres,sub
olcDbIndex: entryUUID eq
----

In addition, ensure the fields mentioned in the help for Username are indexed for optimal performance.

See the information about reverse group membership maintenance in the _OpenLDAP Software Administrator's Guide_.
