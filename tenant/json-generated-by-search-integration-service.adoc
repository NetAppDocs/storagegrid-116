When you enable the search integration service for a bucket, a JSON document is generated and sent to the destination endpoint each time object metadata or tags are added, updated, or deleted.

This example shows an example of the JSON that could be generated when an object with the key `SGWS/Tagging.txt` is created in a bucket named `test`. The `test` bucket is not versioned, so the `versionId` tag is empty.
