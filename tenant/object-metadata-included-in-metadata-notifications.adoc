|===

NOTE: For tags and user metadata, StorageGRID passes dates and numbers to Elasticsearch as strings or as S3 event notifications. To configure Elasticsearch to interpret these strings as dates or numbers, follow the Elasticsearch instructions for dynamic field mapping and for mapping date formats. You must enable the dynamic field mappings on the index before you configure the search integration service. After a document is indexed, you cannot edit the document's field types in the index.
