. Select the username and then select *Sign Out*.

* If SSO is not in use:
+
You are signed out of the Admin Node. The Tenant Manager sign in page is displayed.

NOTE: If you signed into more than one Admin Node, you must sign out of each node.

* If SSO is enabled:
+
You are signed out of all Admin Nodes you were accessing. The StorageGRID Sign in page is displayed. The name of the tenant account you just accessed is listed as the default in the *Recent Accounts* drop-down, and the tenant's *Account ID* is shown.

NOTE: If SSO is enabled and you are also signed in to the Grid Manager, you must also sign out of the Grid Manager to sign out of SSO.
