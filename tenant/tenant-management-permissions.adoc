Before you create a tenant group, consider which permissions you want to assign to that group. Tenant management permissions determine which tasks users can perform using the Tenant Manager or the Tenant Management API. A user can belong to one or more groups. Permissions are cumulative if a user belongs to multiple groups.

To sign in to the Tenant Manager or to use the Tenant Management API, users must belong to a group that has at least one permission. All users who can sign in can perform the following tasks:

* View the dashboard
* Change their own password (for local users)

For all permissions, the group's Access mode setting determines whether users can change settings and perform operations or whether they can only view the related settings and features.

NOTE: If a user belongs to multiple groups and any group is set to Read-only, the user will have read-only access to all selected settings and features.

You can assign the following permissions to a group. Note that S3 tenants and Swift tenants have different group permissions. Changes might take up to 15 minutes to take effect because of caching.
