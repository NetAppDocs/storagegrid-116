You can use S3 Console to view the objects in an S3 bucket. S3 Console is experimental and has not been fully tested.

You can use this experimental tool primarily to view the objects in an S3 bucket. You can also do the following:

* Add and delete objects and object versions
* Rename objects
* Move and copy objects between buckets
* Manage object tags

The experimental S3 Console tool is not intended for bulk management of objects or for use in a production environment. Instead, use S3 Console when you need to perform these functions for a small number of objects, such as when you are uploading objects to simulate a new ILM policy, troubleshooting ingest issues, or using proof-of-concept or non-production grids.

Before signing in to S3 Console:

* You must create a bucket.
* You can optionally export a CSV file containing the user's access key and secret key, then import that file when signing in.

You can access S3 Console from the Tenant Manager Buckets page or Bucket details page.
