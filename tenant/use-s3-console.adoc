You can use S3 Console to view the objects in an S3 bucket.

You can also use S3 Console to do the following:

* Add and delete objects, object versions, and folders
* Rename objects
* Move and copy objects between buckets and folders
* Manage object tags
* View object metadata
* Download objects

NOTE: S3 Console has not been fully tested and is marked as “experimental.” It is not intended for bulk management of objects or for use in a production environment. Tenants should only use S3 Console when performing functions for a small number of objects, such as when uploading objects to simulate a new ILM policy, troubleshooting ingest issues, or using proof-of-concept or non-production grids.

* You are signed in to the Tenant Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
* You have the Manage Your Own S3 Credentials permission.
* You have created a bucket.
* You know the user's access key ID and secret access key. Optionally, you have a `.csv` file containing this information. See the xref:creating-your-own-s3-access-keys.adoc[instructions for creating access keys].
