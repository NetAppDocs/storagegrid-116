. Review the information for each bucket.
+
As required, you can sort the information by any column, or you can page forward and back through the list.

 ** Name: The bucket's unique name, which cannot be changed.
 ** S3 Object Lock: Whether S3 Object Lock is enabled for this bucket.
+
This column is not displayed if the global S3 Object lock setting is disabled. This column also shows information for any legacy Compliant buckets.

 ** Region: The bucket's region, which cannot be changed.
 ** Object Count: The number of objects in this bucket.
 ** Space Used: The logical size of all objects in this bucket. The logical size does not include the actual space required for replicated or erasure-coded copies or for object metadata.
 ** Date Created: The date and time the bucket was created.

+
IMPORTANT: The Object Count and Space Used values displayed are estimates. These estimates are affected by the timing of ingests, network connectivity, and node status.

. To view and manage the settings for a bucket, select the bucket name.
+
The bucket details page allows you to view and edit the settings for bucket options, bucket access, and platform services.
