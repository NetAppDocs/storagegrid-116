You can automate the installation of the StorageGRID host service using standard orchestration frameworks such as Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Fabric, or SaltStack.

The StorageGRID host service is packaged in a DEB and is driven by configuration files that can be prepared ahead of time (or programmatically) to enable automated installation. If you already use a standard orchestration framework to install and configure Ubuntu or Debian, adding StorageGRID to your playbooks or recipes should be straightforward.

You can automate these tasks:

. Installing Linux
. Configuring Linux
. Configuring host network interfaces to meet StorageGRID requirements
. Configuring host storage to meet StorageGRID requirements
. Installing Docker
. Installing the StorageGRID host service
. Creating StorageGRID node configuration files in `/etc/storagegrid/nodes`
. Validating StorageGRID node configuration files
. Starting the StorageGRID host service

== Example Ansible role and playbook

Example Ansible role and playbook are supplied with the installation archive in the /extras folder. The Ansible playbook shows how the `storagegrid` role prepares the hosts and installs StorageGRID onto the target servers. You can customize the role or playbook as necessary.
