The `/etc/network/interfaces` file includes three sections, which define the physical interfaces, bond interface, and VLAN interfaces. You can combine the three example sections into a single file, which will aggregate four Linux physical interfaces into a single LACP bond and then establish three VLAN interfaces subtending the bond for use as StorageGRID Grid, Admin, and Client Network interfaces.

== Physical interfaces

Note that the switches at the other ends of the links must also treat the four ports as a single LACP trunk or port channel, and must pass at least the three referenced VLANs with tags.
