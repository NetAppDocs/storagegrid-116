You must install Ubuntu or Debian on all grid hosts. Use the NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool to get a list of supported versions.

.Steps

. Install Ubuntu or Debian on all physical or virtual grid hosts according to the distributor's instructions or your standard procedure.
+
NOTE: Do not install any graphical desktop environments. When installing Ubuntu, you must select *standard system utilities*. Selecting *OpenSSH server* is recommended to enable ssh access to your Ubuntu hosts. All other options can remain unselected.

. Ensure that all hosts have access to Ubuntu or Debian package repositories.
. If swap is enabled:
 .. Run the following command: `$ sudo swapoff --all`
 .. Remove all swap entries from `/etc/fstab` to persist the settings.

+
IMPORTANT: Failing to disable swap entirely can severely lower performance.
