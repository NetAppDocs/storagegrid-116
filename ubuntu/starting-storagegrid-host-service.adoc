.Steps

. Run the following commands on each host:
+
----
sudo systemctl enable storagegrid
sudo systemctl start storagegrid
----

. Run the following command to ensure the deployment is proceeding:
+
----
sudo storagegrid node status node-name
----
+
For any node that returns a status of "`Not Running`" or "`Stopped`", run the following command:
+
----
sudo storagegrid node start node-name
----

. If you have previously enabled and started the StorageGRID host service (or if you are unsure if the service has been enabled and started), also run the following command:
+
----
sudo systemctl reload-or-restart storagegrid
