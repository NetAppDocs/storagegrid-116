You must download the required files to a service laptop before you upgrade your StorageGRID system.

.What you'll need
You must have installed all required hotfixes for the StorageGRID software version you are upgrading. See the hotfix procedure in the recovery and maintenance instructions.

.About this task
You must download the `.upgrade` archive for any platform. If any nodes are deployed on Linux hosts, you must also download an RPM or DEB archive, which you will install before you start the upgrade.

.Steps
. Go to the NetApp Downloads page for StorageGRID.
+
https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/storagegrid/downloads-tab[NetApp Downloads: StorageGRID^]

. Select the button for downloading the latest release, or select another version from the drop-down menu and select *Go*.
+
StorageGRID software versions have this format: 11._x.y_. StorageGRID hotfixes have this format: 11._x.y.z_.

. Sign in with the username and password for your NetApp account.
. If a Caution/MustRead statement appears, read it and select the check box.
+
This statement appears if there is a required hotfix for the release.

. Read the End User License Agreement, select the check box, and then select *Accept & Continue*.
+
The downloads page for the version you selected appears. The page contains three columns:

 ** Install StorageGRID
 ** Upgrade StorageGRID
 ** Support files for StorageGRID Appliances

. In the *Upgrade StorageGRID* column, select and download the `.upgrade` archive.
+
Every platform requires the `.upgrade` archive.

. If any nodes are deployed on Linux hosts, also download the RPM or DEB archive in either `.tgz` or `.zip` format.
+
You must install the RPM or DEB archive on all Linux nodes before you start the upgrade.
+
NOTE: No additional files are required for the SG100 or SG1000.
+
NOTE: Select the `.zip` file if you are running Windows on the service laptop.
