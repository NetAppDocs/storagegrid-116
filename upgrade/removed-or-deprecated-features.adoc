Some features were removed or deprecated in StorageGRID 11.6. You must review these items to understand whether you need to update client applications or modify your configuration before you upgrade.

== PATCH method deprecated

The PATCH method, used in the Grid Management API and the Tenant Management API has now been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. As required, perform a PUT operation to replace a resource instead of using a PATCH operation to modify the resource.
