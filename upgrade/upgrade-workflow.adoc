Before starting the upgrade, review the general workflow. The Software Upgrade page guides you through the upgrade steps.

* If any StorageGRID nodes are deployed on Linux hosts, you must xref:linux-installing-rpm-or-deb-package-on-all-hosts.adoc[install the RPM or DEB package on each host] before you start the upgrade.

* You upload the upgrade file to the primary Admin Node using the Grid Manager. You will use the primary Admin Node to upgrade all grid nodes for all data center sites.

* To detect and resolve issues, you can optionally run the upgrade prechecks and resolve any issues before you start the actual upgrade. The same prechecks are performed when you start the upgrade. Precheck failures will stop the upgrade process and some might require technical support involvement to resolve.

* When you start the upgrade, the primary Admin Node is upgraded automatically. You will not be able to access the Grid Manager while the primary Admin Node is being upgraded. Audit logs will also be unavailable. This upgrade can take up to 30 minutes.

* After the primary Admin Node has been upgraded, you must clear your web browserâ€™s cache, sign back in, and return to the StorageGRID Upgrade page.

* You download a new Recovery Package.

* You approve which grid nodes to upgrade next. You can approve individual grid nodes, groups of grid nodes, or all grid nodes. You can repeat the process of approving grid nodes as many times as necessary, until all grid nodes at all sites are upgraded.

IMPORTANT: Do not approve the upgrade for a grid node unless you are sure that node is ready to be stopped and rebooted.

* When all grid nodes have been upgraded, new features are enabled and you can resume operations; however, you must wait to perform a decommission or expansion procedure until the background *Upgrade Database* task and the *Final Upgrade Steps* task have completed.

* When the upgrade is complete, you confirm the software version and apply any hotfixes.

NOTE: You must complete the upgrade on the same hypervisor platform you started with.
