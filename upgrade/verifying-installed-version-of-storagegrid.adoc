Before starting the upgrade, you must verify that the previous version of StorageGRID is currently installed with the latest available hotfix applied.

.Steps

. Sign in to the Grid Manager using a xref:../admin/web-browser-requirements.adoc[supported web browser].
. Select *Help* > *About*.
. Verify that the *Version* is 11.5._x.y_.
+
In the StorageGRID 11.5._x.y_ version number:
+
 ** The major release has an _x_ value of 0 (11.5.0).
 ** A minor release, if available, has an _x_ value other than 0 (for example, 11.5.1).
 ** A hotfix, if available, has a _y_ value (for example, 11.5.0.1).

+
IMPORTANT: If you have an earlier version of StorageGRID, you must upgrade to any 11.5 version before upgrading to StorageGRID 11.6. You do not need to be at the highest 11.5 minor-version release to upgrade to StorageGRID 11.6.

. If you are not at a StorageGRID 11.5 version you must upgrade to version 11.5, one release at a time, using the instructions for each release.
+
You must also apply the latest hotfix for each StorageGRID version before upgrading to the next level.
+
One possible upgrade path is shown in the example.

. Once you are at StorageGRID 11.5, go to the NetApp Downloads page for StorageGRID and see if any hotfixes are available for your StorageGRID 11.5._x_ version.
+

. Verify that your StorageGRID 11.5._x_ version has the latest hotfix applied.
. If necessary, download and apply the latest StorageGRID 11.5._x.y_ hotfix for your StorageGRID 11.5._x_ version.
